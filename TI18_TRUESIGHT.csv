"the part of this true sight is Ceb fighting his demons as axe
he was so angry and also so much under pressure that he converted all his emotions into being the King of this match

this is not what normal confidence looks like
its a mixture of anger and realizing its too late to worry and go full FK YOU mode"
"somnus looks like a nerd but for some reason he has a very strong and confident aura 
this guy was a beast
if i could choose a midlaner in 2018 it definitely would be him, best midlaner 2018 for sure"
This is the peak of Dota.

i miss the old OG team!
September 2025😂
October 2025 just to reminding the most great comeback
"2025 rewatching this.😁
LGD 2018 has a mix vibe of Asian nerdiness, utmost briliance and a bit arrogance. Maybe that bit arrogance is what costs them TI."
"Still watch this each year for motivation and inspiration. Such an amazing story, which can only be captured by a great game like Dota2"
Golden era of dota 2

Ceb god of axe
Ana god of carry
Notial god of draft picks
Topson god of mid

"Had to rewarch this. And man, goosebumps still there...."
The Music in 57:00 goosebumps~
"if you have watch this, a bit few years after TI8, you can actually see how Topson passed the Trial of Fire, being a rookie and his 1st ever LAN, an instant TI Champion after passing that fire, Ana was already a monster here at TI8, then at TI9, 2 monsters Ana and Topson synergizes that the TI9 is like kid's game to them, and watching Topson streams after that TI9 till now, his technicality as a player was still a top tier."
September 2025
Ame FeelsBadMan

Still the best True sight ever
25:17 where things shifted

Rewatching coz why not?
"For me, this was peak TI. was there rooting for OG all the way from the qualifiers to the finals. 
Now no more true sight, no more battlepass where your long lost friends come back to play a bit waiting for TI."

The Golden Era in Dota 2.

"Couple more hours before TI14, time to rewatch this masterpiece 🥰"
No team do it like OG.
"The way xnova laugh, :))) that team deserve this loss"

May we all win from the game we are all battling with.
Bring back True Sight ☹️
Since the True Sight has been discontinued because of the sore losers getting demoralized. Why not start another series but this time Focus only in the winners and archived the losers videos. :D
Man any sports is really a mental game if you focus on the negatives it affects your performance so much. That game 4 and 5 was tough to watch as a LGD fan.
Anyone September 2025?A MASTERPIECE CLASS🔥💯
Watching this before the day 3 of ti14 start
Its TI2025 and im just come to watch back the TI8 Grand Final
pure cinema
"Good old days! Yeah! Really good old days. I cry with joy everytime I watch this. What a legendry moments. 
September 6, 2025"

"As I watched XG vs FLCN and NGX vs Liquid, I am reminded of these"

"Ti watching every once in a while counter:

Edit: 5x"
"September 2025 still watching this 
🤚"

"When I lose motivation to play Dota, I come back to TI8 and TI9."
Cant believe this is 6 years ago🥹

Watching before TI2025
Sept 2025
"Sept 4 TI 2025, And i still comeback here just to watch it one more time before the TI14 starts"
2026
Can I say that this final and this comeback were the most insane in the history of TI's?
What did notail said? V¡Ttuwa? Vuttuwa?
it's that time of the year again 🌻
"sept4 2025, still gives me tears everytime i see that notail ending"
"Watchimg this before TI hoping an underdog win Like Boom, Nemesis, or Navi"
ITS THE TIME OF THE YEAR  TO REWATCH THIS MASTERPIECE
"Every time I feel like the world is against me, I watch this Anime-grade TI Run."
Watching the best TI Series and the Best Team in the entire TI Tournament before the TI2025 starts tommorrow
someone still watching this epic TI ?
38:50
First time watching. Decent video.
I watch this when i played mobile legends XD
"After rewatching this over & over again. Ceb is the true MVP, he's such a good coach, player and friend for them. He was their encouragement and cheerleader. Every decisions, mistakes, and hero picks their teammates made he always have their backs and cheering them up. What a guy 🔥"
"Every time I feel down, I somehow find myself coming back here again, it feels like the only place that understands me😢"
Da F Im doing 😂 I am here watching this again 🤣 like so many times 😂
"Notice when OG blunders? None of them blames each other, instead they encourage one another and have a short laugh about it.

Compare it to LGD on Game 5, one wrong teamfight then Chalice scolded everyone then they went silent.

A good team is built on skilled players, but a perfect team is built from friendship, camaraderie, and trust. That's why no one can top OG, they are the perfect team because of NoTails principle: Flowers and Friendship."
this one is the best truesight of all time.
omg i miss this feeling.
Anyone SEPTEMBER 1st 2025??

"Ced carried the team's mentality see the difference when how LGD talks after a game and how GO talks after a game, even when in game and in pressure ceb is always there to assure his team that they're fine goes to show how good of a coach and a player he is, dota is not just a game, it's a test of mentality."
August 26 2025 ????
August 2025 anyone?
N0tail’s reaction before they win game 5 still gets me.

August 2025 anyone??
"8th time watching this in full. Wanting to find motivation. 

Such a class act by OG even in the final seconds of Game 5 they never celebrated too early, it never crossed their minds or mouths that they are finally winning it until the ancient breaks. Just pure competitive instincts until the very end."
Anyone watching aug 2025 ?
"Yea its a tradition that I watch this every month. -Aug 24, 2025"
its Ti time and is Ti8 true sight again.
"August 24, 2025 and I'm still here watching it again."
"That last gasp that no tail takes at 55:13 as he realises he's about to win it, it's gonna be worth it, loosing his friend, rebuilding the team and he's gonna win have it all the air of relief and redemption 💗"
watching this 5x a week 😆

"57:05 ""Shit."" - Ana"
"Most impressive thing for me on re-watch is the grins on their faces walking down the tunnel after losing game 3. Looking relaxed, smiling like they're just having fun out there. When you contrast it to LGD after a loss, it makes it clear how completely un-phaseable this group was in their prime."
any August 2025 rewatchers? haha
"Love from ph, every time i feel the pressure around (problems) I watch this all over again, thanks dota for this wonderful show."

35:58 Ana farming aura. What a badass!
It’s already August 2025. Anyone watching?
Anyone august 2025?
Today?
Nice watch. Would have been cooler though if the narrative stayed impartial till the end.. It shifted in favour of OG quite strongly and obviously from after the 3rd game
"Every once in a while we always come back to this legendary TI Win, Best Line up for OG"
WHO'S HERE WATCHING AUGUST 2025??
"Its not about if Team Spirit or any other team in the future is more ""goated"" than this OG Dota roster or not. The reason we all feel so special about this team is because they display and resonate so clearly what it means to be a human, and what our true nature is. Be courageous enough to help others become their best and take full responsibility only for that which is in your control. Surround yourself with kind people that love and trust you, as much as you love and trust them. Then you will have nothing to fear, not even this LGD lineup ;) . Farewell everyone."
august 2025 anyone?
back here again and again
rewatching this while waiting for the battlepass
We need Battlepass guys like plz
"GAME 4
CEB: ""This is my game bois."" 28:55

He ""called"" it literally and in-game 🔥"
DEFINITELY THE GREATEST TI EVER 🔥
Good time
"im here again on Aug 2025, this is masterpiece"
wow nice movie where part 2?
🔥🔥🔥
I still can't get over how the rest of OG supported topson on this game until he can get back on his feet.
55:13 Give me chills.
"For me this was peak dota. Yes it was great that they won it again the following TI, but the whole backstory behind this team and how they came together, plus the quality of the final matches was the best I'd seen since Alliance vs Na'vi at the TI3 finals. OG Defied the odds and even broke the China curse! One of the greatest moments in competitive videogame history!"
"TI8 will always be memorable. Period! Notail redemption arc, Topson's 3k arc. With just these 2 it's already epic."
Can YouTube make a count for everytime I watch this vid?
August 2025. This truesight never get old ❤️‍🔥
25:16 Legends says he is still wearing his Jacket
From bullying to  cry.
GO home LGD😉
"Whenever I felt giving up on my life, I always watch this video."
"Seven years later and with a few beers, it’s a must-watch again."
Its now a universal culture to visit here once in a while....
"its such a shame they stopped making these, this was one of the few dota related things i used to really really look forward to every year"
August 2025!!!!
August 2025 and still the best TI
"No matter how many times I watch OG’s TI8 win, it always lifts me up. Whenever life feels tough, I come back to watch this video to remind me that even when the odds are stacked against you, miracles can happen."
ABSOLUTE CINEMA! 💗

"My buddy saw me watching this ""old yt video"" today and remarked, ""you have already watched this 20x"". Oh buddy.... Already reached that number within few days it was released and that is still considered rookie numbers. Try 3 digits 🤣"
"Percontohan standar E-sport agar layak menjadi industri. The International (TI) with True Sight, give another e-sport to the next level. Harus distandarisasi begini sih, biar hype dota 2 naik terus dan regenarasinya jalan karena mereka semua, ingin bisa ke TI."
Oh how i miss my dota 2 days

"Im back, please like my comment so i can watch this again in a fee months"

"This magical moment of the ti8, never gets old. It feels new everytime i watch it. The passion and trust of this team to each other is really beautiful. Good old days boys. Thanks to red bull also, they never left behind this team even they hit the rock bottom, they also had full trust to this team , they new that this team can make it to be a T.I Champs."
44:35 Earthshaker thump
July 2025 ?
我也是看否决散失反向波的水人，传送黑锅的被秒TB，被锚击秒杀的隐刀BKB小鱼，被卡神遛狗的巨魔，被油面一刀剁死的幽鬼，被血棘爆死的拍拍，给鸭头肉输血的版本之子0塔伤的小小，集火刷新吼斧王的混沌，0-4三千输出的svp敌法，被三刀砍死的娜迦，蝴蝶龙心买活送李逵的小狗，挑逗皮套人后见面要分手，无冠超Ana，双冠鸭头肉的偶像长大的。你让我黑我家哥哥，我是真的做不到啊！
2025 ❤ still the best True sight ❤

CUCI PIRING

"Ceb be like: Oppa Oppa boys 
Ana be like: Dude im also asian didnt know you were racist 😂"
Going back to this because of the heartbreak of the pacers run in the NBA. Felt their run was as magical as OGs but the difference was OG finished the run.
Who's still in 2025?  lezzgo dota!
Song name @26 min?

"45:30 when i heard ana said ""go ember"" confidently i know lgd we're going fcked"
"Even though it was a few years ago, I still enjoy reminiscing about it. #lakadmatatang"
haven't played dota for years. but everytime i want to watch some dota i always comeback for this masterpiece.
"""Fcking hell, they dare to pick Axe in front of Tusk King""

The best line ever in the TI 😂. 

God Axe makes a call with ""CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB"""
"30:55 ceb went back to 7ckingmad mode, and i have the same reaction same as Jerax 🤣🤣"
"This OG true sight TI8 & TI9 is like harry potter to me, you have to watch it at least once a year."
They should make a movie about this team.
"Anna you want relocate in the base, memes? HAHAHAHA"
strongest team ever
"after Game 3 lose, Ana said ""It doesnt matter"". You know its done, he'll comeback big"
I can't count on how many times I have watched this. Still gives me goosebumps!! Never getting tired of this forever. Forever OG
WHOS STILL WATCHING 2025 GUYS!
no matter what it is were gonna destroy them
My 20th time. Anyone?
Best TI of all time TI 8 and TI 9
"The best TI ever. 
The plot. 
The drama. 
The cinderella story. 

Ana: I don’t know what tf is going on."
"2025 Anyone TI is coming, Ti8 is one of the Best T I"
I always feel bad to fy while watching this over and over again. Dude does everything he can in the early game 😢
"OG vibes immaculate, don't even really fw Dota like that but always cry like a baby when I watch this."
Yeh I reckon Valve stepped up their game from ti7 true sight to ti8.  28 mins to 1 hour!
41:11 start the best moment ti8 is the peak ❤🔥
"2025!
F*k Yatoro hahahaha"
Rewatching this again today for the emotion and hype 🔥🔥🔥
IT IS A TRADITION THAT WE WATCH THIS ONCE IN  A WHILE.
i watch this once every years😎
hello im here again
I'm here again
2025 and I'm still watching this
June 2025 😢. I wish I could go back to the good old days playing dota
No more TI Vibe like this ever
When Valve seemed to care about DOTA2 and the community - Those TI were the thing of memories! OG representing everything you would want in a team and friends
and im here again.....
"Can't stop myself from watching this every once in a while. OG's story really hits like a fairy tale. From the setbacks to the betrayal to the revenge side story from n0tail, this really was the best TI ever. On a sidenote, this roster of PSG.LGD probably was the best team to not have won a TI."
Rewatching this before Ti2025 starts
Alguém consegue dublar esse TI com IA?
🎉Absolute Cinema🎉
ABSOLUTE CINEMA.
"WHAT IF, LGD DIDNT BAN THE CENTAUR?"
"It is me ot it feel like we tend to rewatch this in June 2025, to see this fairy tale ending and hearing CEB word of wisdom for motivation and morale boost?"
sorry i had to go back to this masterpiece. dammit.
The greatest TI ever ❤️
Alwaysv🎉
ceb is the most realistic leader you can have
"The best True sight: 2018-2019, every time I feel low i do come and watch this. OG❤"
I CANNOT STOP WATCHING THIS ESPECIALLY THE SCREAMING AT 55:20
the best TI ever! haha
Drinking Rhum and coke while watching this is phenomenal
So here’s my yearly Father’s Day celebration: binge-watching OG's legendary TI journey.
"Damn LGD was peak this time. Fawless calculations, consistent laning phase and mastery of heroes. Until OG suprised them with unexpected picks and unpredictable playstyle. You know the aegis is not for lgd for 2 times in a row. Its just LGD was in a wrong timeline. OG was meant to win TI back to back"
come here from SRGOG mobile lagend fans
"Literally when I start playing Dota again Im watching this again still fcking cinema man 

June 2025??? HAHAHA"
Coming back again here. This was peak DOTA! This is why it always has a place in my heart.
"OPPA OPPA BOIIIZZ!!!!

ANYONE ON JUNE 14, 2025!????"
56:59 The SHIT from ana cracked me out
I'm here because life is hard lately. I need a reminder to keep trying.
Es ya una tradición venir a ver este documental cada vez que me falta motivación.
2025 Anyone ?
WATCHING THIS EVERY YEAR
"FCK ITS BEEN 6yrs???!! MAN, IM TOO OLD…."
Im backk
"saw a clip on tiktok, and now here I am watching this again"
Anyone?
PSG.LGD's downfall was their ego and pride. They underestimate OG's strats and OG's confidence and dedication to win.
Who here is watching this again?😂 I mean it's a tradition to watch this atleast 3 to 5 times a year😂
Best ti ever but aliance vs Navi ti champ game was underated

"*game 4* 28:56

ceb : this is my game boys

Og's unusual pick made lgd lost their composure. Lgd is literally the best team overall in that ti but they lost in mind games
CN DOTA best DOTO they said ahahah . 5thJUNE2025 here

Dumb ass ego china
Watching Fy God at 55:37 still breaks my heart. He's my favorite support player along with Jerax.
"man, tears everytime i came back here"
"May 30,2025 and this still gives me chills!!!!!!!!!"
30 may 2025
"june 2025

Whenever I need motivation, i go back on this anime-level revenge story of OG."
So inspirational
55:13 that moment you realize you'll win TI
"what is the word ceb use to tell notail ""we are on edge"" ? i think its in french but i cant find it in google translate"
"From coach Ceb
To player Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb"
"May 2025 gang, are you there?"
peak dota ti everyone.
I need motivation so I came back to watch!!!!
what is ceb saying at 31:00 ?
Still the best❤
W
"38:20 fight still gives me goosebumps, This OG team was the bomb"
Its that time of the year again. Rewatching this today as a gift for myself on my birthday. This will always be a tradition for me.
"After 7 Yrs , Im coming back to watch this True SIght. im still GOOSEBUMPS.
We need these Ti Again pls"
Am I tripping or what? did this specific video change? This was not the truesight ti8 I remembered watching. It was more cinematic than this one
ABSOLUTE CINEMA
6 years ago yet i'm still in tears whenever i watched this true sight
"I'm here again, because of TikTok hahahha"
2025 anyone?
"We didn't know it at the time, but we were watching the best DotA team of all time and it's fking beautiful!"
2025. Still give me goosebumps man.
"Coming back for tradition. Everyone on this squad deserves credit, Ana for coming back, Ceb as the leader, NoTail as the heart, Topson for coming out of nowhere, but Jerax's biggest contribution is so modest that it's actually easy to overlook, but it's arguably the greatest of them all. He stayed, even when he didn't have to.
I think it's easy hindsight to brush off given what came afterwards, but S4 and Fly left OG for dead and that was the universal consensus going into TI, no one even gave them a chance. Unlike Ceb and NoTail, Jerax was still a valuable commodity that good teams would have made room for to compete for TI, he had options, and no one would have faulted him for leaving an already cooked team like they do Fly and S4, but he didn't do that. 
It's truly poetic, like the polar opposite of Fly in every way. Jerax could have left to chase TI without giving up anything, but chose to stay, while Fly gave up everything to leave and came up short."
23may2k25 2.01am 🥹
2025 and Im still amazed how this Topson mthrfckr lose his lane everytime but still manage to help the team win. I just have no fkn idea how he does it!
""" Give the boy invoker "" - Ceb❤"
"still watching in 2025, it's been a long road being a fan of fy, still hopes him coming back someday"
"Ceb : Guys, win or lose, we don't care, we play . OG have heart to play dota not just aiming for $$$$"
watch again guys????
"“I don’t know, I mean, I don’t even know what the f is going on”
- best dota 2 carrry ever"
2025
"Leaving this here so people know that someone still watches this. This, for me, is the greatest TI Grandfinals in the history of dota. The story of betrayal, heartbreak and all the drama leading up to this. A team that nobody expected to win playing against the undisputed strongest team at the time and ended up becoming the champions. We will never see another David and Goliath like this one here in Dota 2 history. Watching this still gives me chills to this day."
again and its 2025
"So sad for ame
He deserve ti aegis 😢"
The Best TI we ever see
I watch this if I feel down and worthless. Ceb you are my therapy lol
2025 anyone??

"I always watch this to gain hope in every hopeless situation I'm in, I never skip a year watching this, since this was made. Even how busy my life gets, I always find a way to play this game coz I love this so much, love the trashtalkings, the laugh in game, the fun, the stress it gives me, the tilt and lastly the comeback, I alwasy hope that I'll have my life's comeback, that's why watching this gives me hope for a comeback."
Lgd is very confident .. Sorry you lose

Я счастлив. Эти пятеро мужчин показали мне, что значит быть сильным. Что значит верить в себя до конца, преодолеть и победить. Я верю в них. Я верю в себя.

Благодарю вас, лучший состав OG. Вы навсегда в моём сердечке.

P.S.: Мы сделали, Ana. Мы это, блять, сделали)."

2025 anyone
"Looking at this LGD had 1 plan.. win midlane and finish game within 30mins.. if fail they lose. 
They pick somnus good laning heroes and that’s it.."
When your pub stack makes it to TI and actually wins the whole damn thing
"Can't stop going back here just to watch this Legendary Series, anyone watching this also April 2025?"
"Bro, this True Sight is not enough for me... I need the whole 5 game's inside communication to dive deep with their adrenalines! Hope Dota can released it too!"
The morre u watch ffhe morre u learn
28:14 that moment soo funny of fy 😂
April 2025

Never doubt your teammates even if they play bad
I strongly belive that if I woke up in the morning and I had to play the TI final I would play the best Dota of my life and that's all that would matter to me. If I played my very best nothing else would matter.
best story line ever!!
ceeeeeeeeeeeeeb 2025
April 2025 anyone?
"It's 2025 now, who's still here?"
"I don't know about anyone else here, but it has become a tradition for me to come back and rewatch this almost once a month. This was Peak Dota."
This is my 3rd watch this year
"April 2025, anyone ?"
best fucking TI ever!
"Watching this again to motivate and improve that if you are having a badtime playing Dota, always to remind myself OG did it first"
anyone 2025  ??????
El mejor TI de la historia
I carry the tradition to watch this once in awhile. WHERES THE BOYZ LETS GO OG LETS GO OG BLYAT

The Satisfaction of wiping their Very fragile cocky ego what makes this better. Focus and Determination really is the key
"Ceb, can be my everything teacher and I'll get 101% of everh subject he teaches"
What a true leader look like is Ceb
It's 2025 and I'm still watching this

2025 anyone?
March 2025 and I still find myself missing this
the real lead is ceb
Hello Fly
Still waiting on new True Sight documentary videos to be released. C'mon now. Let's go!
"The ""fils de pute"" is honey to ear for any French"
March of 2025 anyone?
"9:11 I am just amazed at the confidence of JerAx to say ""I'll stun the storm when he comes in"" it is so good man, I mean for those of you that don't know in this kind of situation that is easy to say but hard to execute specially against enemy comfort picks in the pro league like this one"
54:32 bossing
2025 and I miss this OG so much
This video always gives me goosebumps..
ceeeeeeeb
Ame aka Mr Choke in the final(s) 😂😂😂
Watching again now in 2025. Who's with me?

2025?
Fucken Ceb man....what a God of Dota!

They underestimated OG so bad. The karma hits them.
THE BEST TI OF ALL TIME
Come again
"It’s 2025, I’m still getting back to here"
2025 march
Had to rewatch this since I don't have time to play anymore due to work commitments but it's definitely worth watching every once in a while.
I never thought Ceb and xNova on OG 😂
"This destroyed the excitement in pro scene. Dota was supposed to be west vs east. T1 to Ti7, it always alternate, west team and east team winning TI, then TI8 happen. After that, it's all west now. It's boring. Less diversity in the game."
2025 and still watching
2025 gang
"Ame has seen so many fireworks on stage in his life, but not in his honor, incredible😢😢"
2025 and I still get Goose bumps  !!

"I always rewatch this not just as a tradition. But once im down or having a hard time in some point of my life. This reminds me that whatever the odds, just trust the process. Also, Ceb's mindset here is such so damn good."
2025 anyone?
give the boy invoker :d
2025 im here again
"I really wish this LGD lineup had won 1 ti, i love OG win both TI but i really wish LGD could have got 1"
2025 and still the best ti ever
"they think they will win, they lose. They think they will lose, they win."
"My favourite 52:55, when jerax shakes his head and looks like he’s about to cry, he knew they were gonna win TI, magic."
"Just dropping by to hear some motivational words from Ceb. Also, remind me that n0tail never gave up until he got the championship, which is my goal in life, to become succesful."
goddamn ceb is hot
2025 still love true sight :) Dota 4ever
I always watch the OG story first and watch this after. It makes everything special. Every year I always come back to this.
2025 kunka
"2025 NOW, I STILL WATCH THIS AND FEELS BAD FOR FY😢"
Tpson got carried on his first TI. but when he came back on his second TI. he became a monster and showed the world he deserves to be called a TI champ. he literally made every midlaner a joke when he played
What an epic series 2018-2019
40:38 you can notice xiaobet probably matchfixing

It's like an annual tradition to be watching this every year since it came out. Still the best Cinderella story out there.
2025 and still here
Anyone watching this in 2025 ?
FY'S face is a face of defeat because of arrogance
"Ana was holding in this bo5 for his teammates like a wounded one and he believed for what they say, such a good combo)"

Jan 2025…🎉 still awesome!!!
"31:32 Look at the transition from JerAx to Ceb to Topson. In less than a second, all three move their eyes to three different places. In that instant, they check the map, their abilities, and the gameplay itself (I don’t play Dota, but I imagine that’s what it is). In less than a second, they have all the information they need for the play. I know it’s not that complicated, but I think it’s cool."
a true classic
Jan 2025 anyone?

"It's the end of 2024, came back to Dota after 3 years, went to youtube, this came as a suggestion. Watched it, felt it, cried with it. The chants from crowds, almost losing the Ti and a game saving call from CEB. Everything just hit right in the feels. Forgot to Congrats OG back then, Congratulating them now. This True Sight will be the best of all time."
"December 2024 anyoneeee!!!??

Ive been watching 47 times since 2018

Tried to play league for the first time but instead i watched this again XD
"After ti-8 and ti-9 , then covid hits. Ti never been the same again. Ti-10 is somewhat okay but the last 2 ti’s are dead for me. This 2 year stretch of OG dota will always have a special place in my heart. Best times"
Nov 2024 anyone ?
2024
"November 2024 , still here watching this for the 1000th time"
Im here to watch Chinese fans face. 😂

Am i the only one crying after watching this again???
Nov 2024 🔥 still got goosebumps after watching fot the Nth time.
"*Ana: ""I dont even know whats going on, cant even see my hero""* 😂😂"
"Ete fue el TI que me hizo amar el dota, antes lo jugaba simplemente para probar, pero vi todo lo relacionado a el y luego este torneo con estos 2 grandes equipos y me hizo amar el dota."
The reason we came here once a while It's not just about the game. It's the story....
"Not a team of 5 but a Family who trust each other, love each other and got each other backs. GOATED"
"It's 01:43pm and I have class at 2, instead of getting my ass off of YT, I want to finish watching this. 😂 I watch this like a hundred times a year. Man I miss dota 🥺"
November 2024
November 2024 anyone???

November 2024 y'all?
"Nov 1, 2024 😅"
The peak of the International.
Because of this video i stopped playing LoL and started playing Dota. After 2700 games I reached Immortal. Thanks for inspiration OG.
october 2024
October 2024?
"2024, three members of the 2018 OG roster are retired, Team Spirit and Team Liquid already replicated the two championship, True Sight has been scrapped already, so no one can't top this True Sight anymore. 

The GOAT of all True Sights."
Ceeebbbb
"Oh my days😢 
What happened my dota today"
"October 2024 anyone ??
Fathertime 😆"
They almost never show Ame. Maybe he don't talk as much.
miss the old TI
Wild to think Valve killed TI.
"I like to see this moment every year after that, I want new generation of OG take me same emotions"
"Anna worried after losing another fight 
Anna: Who has better late game?
Ceb: We do because we are better! 

I feel like this is when Anna 100% realized that he wouldn't be allowed to lose hope if nobody did either."
October 2024 - Greatest True Sight!
Enough of this.
57:06 Ana did he said Shit! ? 😂😂

Anyone coming from spike bhai stream 😅
Anyone came from Spike’s Stream !
Spike ka link sa kon aaya hai
Anyone came from spike's live 😂
30x i watch this . Its so very historical
2024 now and I am still watching this true sight the best ever
Best TI in the history
"bruh TI fell off now, TI8 and TI9 run are generational, the atmosphere is unmatched."
"Best TI of all time remind me of the hype I was in,,, in all match's GG never to be repeated again"
52:51 ana just said wow LMAO . watched this movie once every year HAHAHA
Came back here for this masterpiece
This might be the axe gameeeee
""" You really like invoker ? give the boy invoker "" - Ceb nice 7cking team mates"
Oct 2024 anyone?
"my 100th time watching this, Imma try not to get tears"
I am on a 10+ games lose streak with -200 MMR. I am watching this again to regain some confidence to play dota again
july 2026 somebody ?
"Gem of true sight 
6th Oct 2024"
2024 and this still gets me. Every fucking time!
55:36  😐
"Don't lie, you searched for this and watched it again"
"This whole game why LGD lost is because one thier staff member jinx it 😂😂😂😂




Just to add one thing. Till 2024 I dont think a team can be this good as OG in 2018/2019. Each of the player in OG that time have thier own MVP play. For example in jerax earthshaker vs team LGD he hit the echo slam and kill a buyback Terroblade. For Ceb he make the huge ceeeeeeeeeb call and win the fight for OG. For Ana he played as ember spirit vs LGD he kill silencer and tp back to base and survive in 1hp. For  notail and topson I cant remember what play they made but I just wanted to said team OG that time almost every one of the players individual skill are just way to good. 😁"
this never gets old 🤧
The best!
Actually this is the best of all TIs

Oct 2024 anyone?
"Sept 2024  12:59AM having a hot chocolate, rain is pouring outside and watching this. Life is soo good"
Just watching truesight casually in 2024..  Different feeling from TI today
Xnova and Ame they dont deserve this kind of teammates
October 2024
It's that time of the year
"October 1, 2024 and still watching this like it was just yesterday"
"I just realized, Ceb already knew Somnus can bully Topson or at least throw his momentum off. They came out on top by playing as a team and out-drafting them by taking out comfort picks of LGD. They were comfortable with each other's energy while LGD threw and lost their momentum. What a team."
The best true sight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Still watchin 2024
SEPT 30 2024 ANYONE? I'MMA FILIPINO I LOVE OG! ANA MY LOVES 🥺
"2024, still coming to this everytime lookin for greatest comeback :)"

September 2024 5th time to watch it haha
"Team Liquid won in 2024 but TI doesnt feel special now, but this TI was very very special considering fly leaving OG and then getting rookie mid in topson, ana who wasn’t playing in pro scene much, 7ckingmad who was the coach and had to come back as a player, jerax standing through the storm with notail and rebuilding the team. This TI sill makes us believe fairytales do exist"
Wooooaaaah its been a few years and Ive watched this a hundred times yet the chills are still there

"No matter what you say, this OG is the best team for me. The best definition of Ultimate Bonding Experience❤"

HERE WE GO AGAIN BOYS. IT'S ABOUT TIME
September 2024 anyone?
Rewatching this before topson aim for 3 times champions
"That moment at 55:13 though, the realization! It's a beauty"
"55:13 Notail's face is full of emotion here, this is the moment when he realize his dream of winning a TI is about to become a reality."
OG's journey to winning TI8 should be turned into an anime. Pure masterpiece
PEAK DOTA
Who's here in September 2024
It's TI again and were required to watch it again haha
Anyone watching this instead of the livestream TI 2024? Bdw hype for these teams were way more and games were way way better then right now.
5 yeas later... The Best T.I of all time.
The best TI series
why are you here again?
Sept 2024
"Here we go again watching this,  the best TI."
I always go back to watching this. Best TI ever.
Peak of Dota 2
September 2024?
Just watch again ❤❤❤
September Rewatch 😅
Peak of dota2
"""pl 25 guys"" gets me everytime . So cold"
Anyone in September 2024?
"The best true sight ever. OG’s Cinderella story hook me up to become a Dota 2 fan. The storyline of OG’s new roster, OG vs EG and OG vs LDG are just a sight to behold."
"Still OG reigning 2 time TI champ, back-to-back Title holder."
"after countless of watching.. it feels great. best games and best moviess.. here i am 2024 watching this gems ..
"
Who is from 2024?😢
"Not even lying I have watched this more than 60 times. If I get red days in dota I watch this and the Red Bull one. When I'm sad I watch this, when I'm happy I watch this. It's like every 15 days of my salary. I will comment again everytime I watch this. THIS IS GODLY."
September 2024 anyone?
Sad that PSG.LGD got tilted so easily... they didn't have the mentality like OG...
This is the best TI ever. I’ve watched this TS like a million times already— and it’s still entertaining 😅😅
"They dare to pick Axe in front of the Tusk king?

This didn't age well, bruh"
I’d rather watch this masterpiece than TI13 filler matches.
these were the days when Dota was a thing
Still legends
"September 2024, still crying after watching this 10x. This is a fucking masterpiece, dota is art, and OG painted a masterpiece."
Very good at comeback
Anyone here after seeingTI 2024? Og era is the best
September 2024
"TI13, and I'm still watching this. Who else, anyone?"
September 2024 and still gives me goosebumps!!!!!
I want TI to be held in the Philippines. I want to hear the crowd roar in every good fight 😂. I want to feel that hype again like in the Manila Major. I miss the good old days of dotes 😊
Honestly TI 2018 and 2019 were the most beautiful and in 2024 I look at these moments with great pleasure.
"I played only dota 1, but this is epic."
September 2024 anyone?
The good old days
Now they are again at rock-bottom. I hope they will bounce back next year but the chances are really slim :(
"Who watch this in 2024 for the sake of nostalgia

Man, I really miss the golden age of DOTA. Look at what they've done to the current TI—where’s the hype? The prize pool is tiny, there's no more True Sight, and we’re seeing less fresh talent. I love DOTA, but this year’s TI just isn’t giving me that spark to tune in."
"Kinda weird every Dota docmentary has the Chinese as this cold blooded mercenary villains in the pro scene compared to their western competitors. Since The International 1 documentary ""FreeToPlay"". HOWEVER here it really shows that even when OG was cornered they never lost attitude, good spirit, always lifted their spirit while lgd kept picking on mistakes on their breaks after any sertback"
I'm here again.... And I don't even play dota. I just love their camaraderie. I watch this whenever I'm sad because watching them win makes me happy. ❤
Thomas Maria Brown Jeffrey Lewis Cynthia
September 2024. This truesight feels like its just yesterday.
"Nah, gotta revisit the good era TIs before the current one starts."
Watching it again to get my mind ready for TI13. Excited
Missing the old dota.
Man If you feeling down just watch Ti..
39:13 Jerax and Ana's legendary moment 😂

Another TI tradition dead to a complacent Valve. Prize pool gutted and now don't even get get True Sights 😢
It's TI season. Time to rewatch this masterpiece.
Who's here before TI 13???
"Movie night in cinema ❌

1 day before this year Ti 🎉🎉🎉
"Whenever a new TI is announced, we go back here to watch TI 8 and 9."
"i like how this cinema make OG like MC of the world that time, BEST DOTA!"
Always Watch This True Sight when TI is coming
On God this never fails to bring emotions
"September 2024 anyone? Whenever I'm having a hard day, I'm alway watch this to keep worth fighting for. Stay strong boys -Ceb"
Rewatching this because this year’s TI does not feel the same.
I guess I'm back here again after a long while.
"its been 5 years and this still gives me the chills, what a run man!"
"Still goosebumps,2024 🎉🎉🎉i miss dota with friends"
September 2024

Chinese Kingkongs
"July 26, 2024. Here I am watching this whole video at work and it still gives me chills! Damn, I cannot believe it has been 6 years since OG got their first TI trophy"
"55:13 poor Johan has been waiting for this moment for so long, that gasp and then after the game ends his initial lack of celebrating is basically one massive stress reaction. That's so much weight being lifted off his shoulders at once he's not even realising it at first. Great stuff!"
When fireworks are booming over your head but since you loss it's not for you to celebrate so you just look at the screen blankly
"Being a tank player for over 30 years in various games myself, i personally understand that one moment of sensation when he blinks in with low hp. people try to find so many different builds with assassins and carries, but you cannot beat a simple old time rock and roll tank if played properly."
Im here again july 26 2024 ..my favorite dota series ever

July 2024 and still watching. This Truesight is ICONIC. I always go back at this when i feel like i am about to give up to remind myself that OG did it and so am i. 👊
Feeling low just watch this comeback of a lifetime - July 2024.

To have a never give up attitude like n0tail.
To always have a smile on my face like Jerax."
Lakad Matatag!!!
July 2024 anyone?

NO SMOKING ZONE AND NOTAIL SMOOKING RIGHT INFRONT OF THAT BOARD IS BADASS

July 2024
LGD being picked as a powerhouse and favorites to win every single year and yet they haven’t won a single TI. 😅
"- Johan, we won TI!
(3 seconds pause of utter disbelief)
- *bursts into laughter*

Love this moment so much! This true sight is a masterpiece"
"LGD so focused on OG, and not their own game."
July 2024 still cant move this clip in my memories.
It's 2024 but i keep on watching this TI finals. imagine the pressure. when i play rank games in the immortal bracket man then the pressure comes my head gets numb. cant even feel my fingers clicking buttons. how about in this kind of situation i just cant imagine it 😅
July 2024
Fy is my hero anyway.
"“They have a really big problem. PL level 25 guys 💀”

"Back at it again ""OG"""

jerax just laughing when ceb trashtalk psg on 4th game 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"June 2024, Anyone?"
I watch this whenever I lose my rank games
35:57 damn this was a good shot
"i dont really watch the ti's especiially back then. During the first game, a player pointed out(and later on joked) about Ceb holding a bunch of papers. I just came from watching truesight 21 and both teams had stacks of papers to help them with the drafts, did he start that trend or more like an erly adopter or something?"
Why am I watching this again ? )) Really good TI
Now we learn about history
Yup... still coming back here
"1. Shawshank Redemption
2. Inglourious Basterds
3. True Sight TI8

My favorite top 3 movies to rewatch, and you know why this is not nr1? Because they dont show ana PL buyback ana ember echo dodge."
bring back true sight pleeeeaseeeeeeeee 😭
Forever 😢😢😢😢
"Its like im watching a anime season godham

This is beautiful"
"This series is still the greatest esports matchup of all time and nothing comes close.  In particular, that game 4 was legendary.  What an amazing storyline and display of skill from all the players involved."
2024 watching thisssssss
June 2024 anyone? 🔥
ITS ALMOST TIME GUYS!
June 2024 anyone?

june 2024 anyone?
June 2024 anyone here who loves OG?
"the most magical fairy tale run ever 🙂my favorite video of all time

Its like roger declaring one piece is real😁"
Ahh. It's this month of the year to rewatch this masterpiece of a tournament.
Another year. Still watch for the Chinese team shame wall after trash talk early game
Whos still watching this June 2024 ?
We need the true sight back
"25:19 this dude, jinxed LGD. WTF"
"Man, this time of the year again rewatching this before TI"
June 2024 anyone still watching?
OG is the real OG
June 2024 anyone?

"no pressure just have fun the best advice from a team captain ccccccccccceeeeeeeebbbbbbb
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
30:59 🤣🤣🤣
June 2024 anyone?
June 2024 anyone?
Ana selling items at game 4 for buy back is unbelievable
Its 2024 i watch this atleast once every year . Honestly at 45:30 when ana suggested ember it was really a genius pick think about it if you have a team who doesn’t listen to your opinion nor doesn’t support and believe you in every circumstances they wouldn’t win this game.
"Watched it for more than 10 times already, and its still so fkn magical everytime. Still getting emotional and proud.. Cant wait to see them at the next TI. LETS GO OG!!"
June 2024🫡
Junio 2024 alguien ??
30:58 I love how Jerax just laughs afterwards
"If you compare QQQ and Xiao8's coaching 

You can easily see the difference 
I feel bad for this 2018 roster unlike the 2021 roster of LGD that received a motivational speech from Xiao8 when they are down 0-2"
June  2024 baby
June 2024 here 😢
sst
"Hello 2024, back at it again"
This is timeless
"alguien me escribe lo que dice ceb 
min 30:58"
It's now the season to watch true sight
you know it get reals when Ceb starts trash talking in french
IT SSO FCNG BEEEEESTT!
I find it awkward that the backstage/area is shared by both teams. It's awkward talking about the game and the other team is just next to you. lol
28:14 HAHAHA
best TI ever 2018
BRUH i miss this old dota 2 but now its a lot of bullshit thats i play league now cuz its hard tp play dota 2 now if you quot since 2019
N0tail looks like the thousand yard stare meme and I can't unsee it
"To me one of the most iconic lines in this TI is Topson at the end saying ""WE WON TI, WTF?"", while hugging Ana"
one of the Best TI still
"I came back for like the 5th time to watch this legendary Dota TI because OG posted a throwback from this time.
Times go past so fast…
14 + years ago in Sweden in my teens I heard about N0tail being top ranked and one of the best. Later on I got to witness two TI wins by the best Dota team ever made. They had it all…
Charisma, amazing personalities, believing in friendship and winning in a human and mature way(no greed from any player) and all just pushed themselves to the max. True love, True friendship. Keeping spirits up and keep looking forward not backwards like other teams do. They keep looking so much at what they do wrong during tournaments instead of make adjustments in a nice way like OG did"
"People trying to pick the most essential player in this team. The thing is this won’t work if one of them is missing, thats why they won the second the following year."
It's 2024 But still TI8 is The Best!
"Ok, I'm here again"
"Best and most hype ti, Ana spec plays, Ceb axe calls plus ana pl items sell plays, jerax rubick and ana ember. not saying the others didnt have an impact but they were mvp for the particular games"
The power of friendship
May 2024 anyone?
37:24
"The best true sights are OG's, nothing comes close after that."
cokin bangsat mampus
The. Absolute. Best.
How notail act @17:30 shows he is very calm and not put Topson into the bad feeling situation. I like how is very constructive and peaceful no anger.
CCP LOST NAZI WON
2024
Still the best True Sight as of 2024
"I can't take notail at the end man, him tearing up gets me messed up just from the story, can't imagine living it. Must have been overwhelming for months after."
I have lost count on how many times I rewatch ti8😂
"We already in 2024, and this Final always be the greatest TI Final ever in 1 decade"
PRESENT!
"""Fucking shit, don't jinx us."" - Somnus 2018"
"Every year I will definitely come back to watch this
IDK why

who same here"
"Once a year, its a tradition we must see this masterpiece"
2024 still watching
Idk psg coms just is so toxic talking abt their enemy
CEBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB @2024
"35:57 this is the best scene. The terror a PL 25 caused in 2018, it had no match."
"'we are getting tested, embrace it'"
2024 anyone?
the power of friendship 🌻
Johan prophet anybody?
"I realized that the story telling on this video is actually superb, they made it look like OG had lost so bad in the early game and that it was almost unwinnable. The truth of the matter is that Somnus had to leave midlane because he got sincerely crushed by Topson Mk and thus had to leave the lane. and play trilane against ceb treant"
Always coming back to watch it at least once a year
That pain to psg lgd. Both played so good.
Watching and still . . .. . . . . . .. . .ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"Well its 6th May 2024

And im back to rewatch"
Best media ever created in Esports history... Now do something like this for CS  lol.
Year 2024 still watching it
Watching this from year 2024 it made me cry.. it was fucking hype and intense watching those team fights. Memorable.
It's 2024 but this still gives me chills and excitement.
6 Years ago. I still remember.
*IT'S 2024 AND I'M STILL WATCHING THIS MASTERPIECE.*
Make TI great again. Beautiful.
"45:52 is one of my favourite part. Topson is hesitant to show his true capabilities, but there's OG who pushed him to trust himself."
"why does it feel like Ame only exist in a game, but not on this film?"
😮
Depends who you wanna fuck them with.
One of the best TI! Watching this right now for the 10th time! 😁
"""I have 15000 hours of dota, whatever they have, I have more"""
"TOPSON ""IS THIS GUY FOR REAL?"""
I rewatch this everytime I need something to spark in my mind. 2024 anyone?
Continuing the Tradition. (watching once in a while)
watching  05/01/24
2024 and I still love it!
"its a little ridiculous, but the winning attitude and confidence in the face of failure has taught me a lot. you have your team, and a goal. Trust your gut, do everything you can. Bring your team up at all costs, and most importantly, have fun. 

Brody - Primary Care Paramedic <3"
dota 2 peek
2024 this true sight motivation !!!
"28:40 ceb saying ""This is my game boys"" just hits hard when he got his highlight for that legendary dagger call especially with the hyping of the announcer shouting the infamous ""CEEEEEEB"""
Oh Gee....Oh Gee... Your TI 8 winners! <3
"52:52 i know it’s kinda late for this question but anybody know what Ceb and n0tail scream after the roshan fight, like in which language and the meaning of it?"
World one of the best final
As with all sports there no way to keep all that talent together for long.
2024 attendance
Comeback here every year. Best ti ever❤
i wish and hope LGD wins the next TI!!!!
That axe call won OG not 1 but 2 TIs.
"""give the boy invoker"" is still the best phrase used by ceb <3"
"I worked the Late Game Show next door at Queen Elizabeth Theatre and was in a room with security, the coordinators, and OG right after they won it all and were waiting to go up on stage for their interview. It was a really cool moment to see, they were in complete disbelief as to what just happened, not much talking, just trying to comprehend what they did (and probably how much money they all just won). This was maybe 10 minutes after the match finished in Rogers Arena. It was a tense moment, and I'm happy I worked the event as someone who plays Dota and could understand how big this was."
"somnus saying ""kunkka"" gives me goosebumps no horror movies can do"
i religiously watch this once in a while.
gem)
Already 2024 and i still watch it... Epic comeback
I want to know what is the soundtrack when they distroying the ancient in the last game?
Who’s watching this in 2024? Still got me a roller coaster of emotions
En 2024 on est TOUJOURS SUR LES NERFS !!!
ceb the definiton of the pump pump fruit..
Ggez hahahahahah who's still watching it in 2024 😂😂😂
I dont know how many time i watch this just to motivate myself
"and here I am again, reliving one of the best storylines that esports will ever put out. This is a cinematic masterpiece, from qualifiers down to the final seconds of the G5 win."
Ceb before crucial games reminds me of Aragon at the black gate of Mordor. Guy always has the right words.
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb!
this is the best Truesight and the best Final TI for me..
masterpiece of all time
"Today I was feeling dawn cuz personal thinks, YT recommended this ;) I love OG
OG forever 🌻😎💪"
2024 anyone?
Who else is here from 2024? This never gets old.
Jerax's call made OG win the final game. He is so underrated
Still getting goosebumps 2024 still watching
"5 years in a row watching this masterpiece

I LOVE YOU SO MUCHHH DOTA"
I want to understand what Ceb said in 31:05 mins that made Jerax laugh.
EVERY DOTA 2 FANS TRADITION IS TO WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE MULTIPLE TIMES IN A YEAR.
04/15/2024 watching this cause i miss peak OG
55:36 this scene man 😢
i know it's been 5 years ago but damn i can't move on🥲
Watching here in 2024 still gives me goosebumps. Man those days are amazing.
Anyone watching in 2024 ?
На мой взгляд это самый эпичный Интернешнл в Истории!❤❤❤
"the last part gave me chills, insane how notail predicted this and well deserved <3"
game 4 is scary....
I´m here once again! after 5 years watching my best team in Dota 2 ever!
"April 08, 2024"

"Notail : is the KING who own it
Ceb: is the PRIME MINISTER who make strategy and predict enemy movement
JeRax : is the FIELD MARSHAL who lead the Army and make decision based on enemy movement
Tomson : is the GENERAL in the frontlines 
and
Ana : is a God Of War Himself who descend with his only purpose is to annihilate enemy"
Jeerax using techies😂😂

Dammit. LGD is really like anime villain.

Notail : If i play TI Finals nothing else would matter. this give me goosebump
"I lost 350 mmr and now I’m watching true sight, I hope I’ll be inspired again and gather my strength"
I still cannot believe how well this documentary looks. Even 6 years later. Well played OG and PSG-LGD
Still the best fairytale story i have ever witnessed. Ti8 OG will always have a place in my heart. lol
OG❤️
It's 2024 and you always comeback to this masterpiece ❤
JERAX - 50% OF OG WORK  PROPLAYER  MAZTER
BEST TI EVER
"Almost 6 years in, and this is still a tradition to watch this very masterpiece."
"-They are all messy, they are just dumbasses
-The team that wins the first game always lose the TI finals.
-The Ultimate turtling team - OG
-Quas-Wex Invoker again?
-Who do they think they are?

OG in the meantime and wins the finals in silent:"

This gives the most chills followed by game 5 drafting of Spirit - LGD
Coming back again and again
Best team in dota2 history. Especially next year.
Still here 2024 ❤
Never bored watching this over n over again
"Ceb(Axe): ""This is my game boys"" 28:57"
49:47 Йохан Профет энибади?))
its 2024 and im still having goosebumps!
Aquela saida dos dois player da lgd para fumar cigarro sozinhos foi determinante para destabilizar o time. Enquanto o unico fumante da OG era o notail e todos iam junto com ele para fumar passivamente.
Damn rewatching this is sad after seeing ame's apologizing to somnus after all those years he still carries the burden
Still watching this 😂
Relive the History.. Dota❤
I come here every month to get the HAPPINESS & MOTIVATION for that month
"If you think something impossible, just remember Topson first dpc tournament win is The International"
❤
2024 squad!
Back in 2024
31:02 What does ceb say?
every year i will be watching this no doubt.
2024 this is still a classic 💖
I comeback here once in a while specially when Im depressed.
"Whenever I feel down, I immediately prepare a good food and pop-up this thrilling and unforgettable moment of OG. Thanks to True Sight! ❤"
Ive watch this almost 3thousand times and still counting...
Ti8 and Ti9 is still the best so far. Ti10 is next
2/15/2024
Year 2024! Let see how many still watching TI8 for getting motivation in life….
Lgd need focus on game don't need to trash talking or look down on og
2024 anyone?
Its 2024 but still I come to watch regularly 😊
"After I lost someone very dear to me I lost the feeling of emotions.
I felt like an empty vessel. 
Discovered this video 3 years back, and since then I come here once every while so that I can feel emotions.
Thank you Truesight"
who came to watch this back again in 2024🥂
"Normal people watch home alone during Christmas, legends watch this!"
"Thank fuck they didn't censor everything. I like to hear the real comms not BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP every 2 words. Its not kindergarten, everyone wants to hear the true comms."
"The most hyped TI ever srsly, 2024 still watching."
BEST TI hands down
"They were not a powerful team but probably the best team to go against..like Moon said, ""The battle of endurance"".."
"@dota2
Somebody has freebooted your music on his video. 

https://youtube.com/shorts/n7_a1PT7zhY?si=pRjuk238waUhYhar"
They can even make fun while they are losing that is amazing mentality
Amazing
gg
"Prime dota 2 in my opinion, nothing can top the narrative, the underdog, and the rise from the bottom to the top. Truly what an amazing experience that was. One of the best Tis of all time."
FINALS OF ALL TIME
Still watching in 2024
"Ever since the betrayal arc, dota has mostly been about OG and anyone who went against them, seems to recieve karma. They went on to win 2 TIs. Fly and S4 have been cursed for it. Cr1t shoulder tackled and got cursed. Nikobaby 6v5 cursed. TorontoTokyo saying ez game, gets kicked by Spirit, and they became 2x TI winners without him. Secret beefed with Ceb in 2020 and now they are struggling. With every ups, there comes with downs. The lineup after TI10 was doing well at first until they got hit with the visa problem and never really recovered from it. The OG magic continued with the substituding but it didn't last long. Sure, OG in 2023 was painful to watch, but this 2024 lineup is doing wonders and ending games super fast so far. Ceb as a monster pos 5 is really amazing. Plus alot of OG agents have been planted, currently Topson and MC destroying Tundra from the inside, Miracle, iLtW, Ammar and Sumail for Nigma, Midone in Secret, DM Entity, Ana for a short while in RNG, Liquid and T1, JerAx was in the EG bulba era, Taiga in Wildcard and Bleed, and Moonmeander  awaiting to being planted in the next team. Beautiful"
"2024, I still love to watch OG True Sight!"
Where's True Sight 2022? 2023? :ccccc
"This is a great OG story, but what most people forget is for how long Somnus (or Maybe with his old nickname) has played so well, so consistently at the top of the competitive scene, and still hasn't won his aegis. He truly deserves it."
"Best OG, Best True Sight"
"Gabe, Make True Sight again, thanks! Your Community ❤‍🩹"
The confidence and mindset of each team is just so inspirational! It's 2024 but I just can't get over with this TI !
it's 2024 and this is still the best TI in my heart ♥️
It always feels like a nightmare moment when lgd lost their final match for a Chinese player like me. But I totally understand its such a legendary story if we get rid of all these bias and enjoy it in a fair way.
"man, this year I still watch this film. TI8 is really very good to watch so far"
Still have the excitement.
"14:04

ceb: i feel bad for them

also ceb: i dont feel bad for them, f em"
I like this till now damn man 2024 fuck
2024 still watching this
even 2024 its still fire wow.
Jerax yelling man up in game 5. So clutch
that phoenix gameplay by FY god I hope fy wins TI before he retire
2024 boyz?
"2024 lets go! 
eventhough im not playing dota anymore, coming back watching this  is a must even once a year.."
Legend said LGD still blame the guy who jinx it. 
GOD ANNA
I watched again cuz i miss it best ti so far!
Coming here for 20th times.
I watched this five times but still the feeling is like a first time so hype and it give’s me chills the best true sight ever 👌
You watch this video to get that feeling again. It's like therapy. ❤💯
2024 and still 🫶
2k24😊
2024 First still best True Sight of all time 🤙
happy new year guys
xNova ❤
"People who still watch this true sight TI !! 
 ↓"
"I am here for the fire work :"")"
"25 December 2023, and i still get goosebumps"
Prime liquid and prime og going against each other is like barca vs real mardrid
"Can we all agree that a good portion of what makes this fun to watch is watching how PSG.LGD lose? 😅 Everyone's already praising OG, and at this point we all know their story, but I don't see there's a lot of people talking about PSG.LGD during this TI. Maybe because it sounds mean to say it, but we all know what it is. 

First of, the fans were like ""GO HOME OG"" and then the next game they're like all heartbroken 😅 freaking love those scenes. Second, PSG.LGD themselves. Overconfident, smug, arrogant, then boom--lost TI8 😅 They underestimated OG BIG TIME and they only went sweating when they were pushed to game 5. I gotta say they deserve the loss because of it. Finally, I can't help but notice how Fy was the most ""serious"" among them. At least from this video, he didn't seem to trashtalk OG and be arrogant that much like Chalice and Somnus. Out ot all of them, it's Chalice who was super arrogant and overconfident. I mean at 50:23, he went on to charge into OG thinking they were feeding, only to *lead the charge to their team getting whooped* . After the battle, Chalice goes on to blame the team for not having TPs. Like dude, you underestimated the enemy. It was you who decided to rush in, and now you're blaming your team? OG wasn't feeding, it was you who fed your team to the enemy 😅 

And sadly, I noticed Fy seemed to have been annoyed by Chalice's remark. I think he too felt that Chalice was the one at fault and was being a bad teammate for blaming the team for his idiotic mistake. It's true that Fy's unfortunately being led away from the Aegis, and maybe it's also because of teammates like Chalice, and their overall attitude of underestimating the enemy. It's like Fy is in NoTail's shoes but worse. To their credit, PSG.LGD was too proud--too proud to even call GG and watched their Ancient explode."
L A K A D   M A T A T AG ! ! !
After this TI every ember cary bought euls 😂
Best TI
ana switching tabs lol
"if i ever want to have goosebumps, i go back and watch this."
"I'm back for the nth time and I'm just looking for the ""on est sur le nerfs"" clip but ended up watching the whole thing again. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME."
"This ain't just Esports, This is much much more, and we will always come back here till we get Old Gamers, To remember the good old times,"
When THE SUPPORT SHOUT CALL JUST TRUST ME THEY HAVE ADVANCE HAKI...
Watching the face of those arrogant chinese losing is so satisfying
Don't get me wrong! I love OG but they say some corniest shidd in their convos when looking back at it again after some years😂
it's the end of 2023 but I still get goose bumps..
Hi OG ❤️
.
"Lmao when axe was picked Ceb was like ""youre gonna see some shit man XD"""
Still gives me chills OG 😬😍

It's nearly 2024. But I'm still here
Still the best
Which one is xnova and fy ?
Ogggg
"It's 2023 and I still Imagine Fly watching at this moment, no emotions just him staring at the screen, while notail grabs that aegis."

Since 2 TI's no True Sight i need to Throwback all of Masterpiece of True Sight
"55:36 the dark side of sports, you need to crushed someone else dream in order to achieve yours"
really miss this era
ceb took it personal
That guy at 8:38 must be a huge OG fan.  Love his hype.
"Team Spirit won TI again this year. But I still come back to watch this masterpiece. The betrayal, the revenge, the comebacks, the plays. Everything in this TI is just the greatest."
"I've watched it again today because I want to feel good and boy it really made me feel good, 1:00.14 I forgot about the stress I have 💙"
No more Chinese! No more course! No more anime!🍀🌻🔥 Just gaben game name!👴
"I just realized that lgd in that ti is the best Chinese team ever, especially the coach."
Missed those feelings. TI12 sucked.
"Best story is ti8 & ti9
Drama, Friend and Ceeeppppppp!"
topson a lucky mf
They might not be the only two-time TI winners but they are the 1st team to do it and the first ever to do it BACK TO BACK. 💚
It’s always crazy to me how OG practically drafted in Game 5 on vibes and won TI
4 years and still an absolute gem
Well. In Ti8 Grand finals. Who ever bought Bkb Loses The Game
Still the best TI💕
"nov 2023, i'm still here watching every year😂"
omg... i watched this for the 5th time aftert 2023 Ti Finals. And everytime this story bring tears to my eyes at the end. Such a motivational and inspirational story. Greatest E-Sports story ever.
"Ceb: this is my game

Then proceeds to MVP the game"
will always be the best TI + true sight
Still watching this every now and then
"""How to make a grown man cry?""

Make him watch  True Sight 2018 and 2019 :'D"
I love watching true sights. Props to PSG.LGD team for being a formidable opponent to OG
best TI ever
*30:39** lakad matatag*
No one will ever  top this. Thanks to OG for giving such an experience. This is true DotA.
Whenever i feel depressed i watch this! That ceeeeebbbb always cheers me up!❤💙💙

Best true sight

The Best Truesight so far
Still the best TI. Hands down.
Best Ti ever!
Here we go again after TI12!!! Congrats Team Spirit.
"""Holy crap, Ceb is holding a bunch of papers."" still gets me everytime 😂"
I miss this true sight :(
It makes me feel good every time I come back and watch it. It's really awesome.
52:51 Look at Jerax emotions ❤
"OG humbled PSG.LGD. These guys really though that the TI8 aegis was served on a plate. Turns out,  they couldn't be more wrong."
"We will never get another TI like this, the story of OG from the start of the season to lifting the aegis will be always remembered by us. There are a lot of eSports stories across other games that's quiet mentioning but this, this just hits different. Truly an emotional and historic run."
til merlini was casting in the finals
After TI u wish there will be a true sight for it. Another movie on the list at the least 😔
still the best true sight for me
This is the best to watch after every TI
Had to come back and watch this again after seeing TI12... nothing compHres
Still the best TI
Back here after Team Shit won TI for second time.
Somnus is moron
Post-TI ritual to watch OG's cinderella story🔥
IT'S THAT TIME OF THE YEAR AGAIN
best ti finals ever
Ti12 check
"Greatest TI of all time and one of the greatest moments in all of esports history. Friendship and betrayal David vs Goliath, the emotions of winning and losing, the exciting comebacks, this one had it all."
"after TI,  it's TS 2023"
im here after Team Spirit win it twice and ready to dethrone OG
OG was the better TEAM.
It's something to watch once a while
36:35 what a hell of a join fight i will gonna be pissed of if this happens hha
Here after fy lost in heartbreaking fashion to GG
"""15,000 hours what ever they have i have more than them "" what a word its really hit me"
"""This is my game boys"" 28:56

-Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb 2018 38:47"
Damn!!!  Please ban magnus when the fight is do or die. Ffs. I feel so sad for ame
The greatest true sight in history of Dota 2.
Ti again. Tradition!
Watching every year and still the greatest underdog story so far
Will never get tired of watching this. Kept coming back to this! ❤
"Watch this for 4 years, atleast 3 times a years and still have the emotion of the 1st day i watched this. Greatest fairy tail in Dota and in esport, i think"
Best T.I LGD THE JUGGERNAUT OF DOTA . OG KING OF COMEBACK🎉❤
"Ceb is hands-down the single most important factor why they won TI. Not only did he produce the Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb moment which saved their ass, but also the mental strenth he brought to the team. Hes trully a master mind."
And this is the day Topson bloomed to a handsome Godson.
Best ti
man at 55:14 notails face pushing ancients the moment he realized he won it
bros went from living with their parents to taking turns living in each others mansions.
。。。。my heart was blooding
5:28 n0tail's shoulder was bumped by Cr1t during interview. ROFL.
Watching again
2 days for TI12. Its always a good time to watch this again.
Still watching 2023  October and most probably will still keep on watching years to come 😀
"4:40 ""The final two teams vying for the Aegis of Champions. PSG.LGD vs. OG"" So goosebump 🫡"
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeebbbbbb!!!!!
"Whenever I want to quit Dota, this documentary will pull me right back in."
Look at how those two teams manage their morale during the whole contest. It was such a natural but stupid thing to say such things at 41:40 especially from a coach and It's ultimately a mind game
40:17 Jerax breaking into smiles is a beautiful moment.
"""where's axe?"""
"When are they gonna make a ""Proper"" Esports anime. They already have the best storyline with OG.❤"
The legendary OG squad. To this very day...never seen a better team setup since this one.
20:15 lol
Still the best TI true sight. What a fucking game.
"One last ride Johan.
One last ride."
This is my game boyz!!!
I feel bad for LGD PSG Fan  watching this game but for us OG we fooookiiiiinggggg love this we watch this once in a while it's a tradition 🎉❤
What happened to venues like this one? The TI this year looks so cheap.
Still gives me goosebumps after all those years greatest TI champions
Spoiler they will did the same next year) bring aegis for 1 day and took it back😂
This is therapy.
the trashtalk is insane xd 19:55
"I live how ceb lift up his teammates the true leader, how many time I watched this and im not gonna be get bored watching this best grandfinals of T1"
It's time once again💯💯💯
Play those fire works but not for me
2023 still watching this.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Rewatching before ti 🎉
"I watch this once a year. before Every internationals
so good"
Now everyone is using a Thick paper 🤣🤣🤣
"5 years later, still the greatest Dota Story in History"
That was so close for LGD.
"this is the moment that i will cherish forever, playing with my friends."
"every year i will remind myself to come here and watch this beautiful story, notail ceb jerax topson ana each one of them got  a special tale on their own. to me on god this is the best esport moment in the history of esport. i love dota these 5 players will never be forgotten <3 OG till these days is still the GOAT."
CEEEEEEEBBBBBB
I've watched this over a dozen time and I still can't get enough of Somnus' face at the end. On top of that all their fans' faces. I just love it.
"I can't believe im saying this: I believe LGD might win TI12 but my head's not crazy about Team Spirit. 
But this will always go down as, the story of two Dynasties. The Comeback Dynasty vs. The I know what you're going to draft but can you do anything about it Dynasty"
"So many years have passed, although I’m not a fan of the Dota universe, these guys from OG amazed me, I'm very happy for these guys.❤"
still fuck you FLY we wont forget your betrayal notail deserves this shit.
Ahhhhhh still re-watching this video🤑
The peek of dota! never gets old
I just rewatch this now and notice we got the same shoe as ceb with new balance 515 v3 lmao
Somebody know the soundtrack in the minute 43:00 to 44:11
This is one of the greatest videos here in this platform.
This never gets old
TODAY TI12 🎉
Please back Ana
Good old day
Masterpiece💯
I don't play dota anymore but I play dota
"It is a tradition to watch this iconic battle every year, never gets old."
Tradition to watch this just when TI starts❤
2023 👋👋👋👋👋
always watch before T.I
TI season means rewatching this for the gazillionth time
It is that time again
Whenever I feel sad. I always go back to 55:42 and my mood changes to happy in an instant
When you watch it for an hour and doesn't feel like you wasted your life. (multiple fuqing times)
when im feeling bad sometimes i watch this video still best ti and now im still cant stop crying(im always cry that winning moment)
Лучшее что я когда либо видел
Always rewatched this every time i feel sad or having a bad day..
chinese crowd toxic asf
Rewatching this before the next ti
The end of 2023 and I'm still watching this true sight coz it was the best ti final I've ever seen
"There are no words to explain Topson's feelings after this final. I mean, this is literally his first competition and the pro-scene, has $3000 in his pocket, and wins TI on a first attempt? If there is anyone who has the most sheer amount of luck, it would be Topson. Gigachad!"
Still the best thing happened in DotA ❤️
2018 fight with blood.. 2019 fight with fun.. 🥳
it’s sad to see OG are not in the list of TI12 but comeback stronger guys. Even we miss this roster so much. But what we can do is to always support in everyone decisions of life.
It's that time of the year again.
Still one of the best TI
pag brokenhearted ako eto lagi ko pinapanuod haha
"4 day before TI and here we are, rewatching the greatest true sight of all time"
"OG break the curse of TI. I remember watching this game Live with my friends it feels nostalgic.

This is the best TI and best TRUE SIGHT
""I wanna play Dota"" 
""I love Dota""
Damn I wish I could turn back time but now got a lot of responsibilities. 😭"
So satisfying to see PSG lose 😂
"This True Sight always reminds me that, whenever you feel struggling and loosing, just keep going, just don't give up, you're almost there.

Like what they did, they almost lost at game 4 but they pushed themselves harder. Love these guys."
Before TI always gonna watch this... but where is true sight for ti11?
Still the best game ever played
2023 and this masterpiece keeps on showing in any social media platform. It's a fckn tradition y'all
stg this is sooo goood 💅 I've rewatched all true sight and this gives me the thrill 🔥
2023 October anyone?
CEB WAS ACTUALLY CALLING IT BEFORE AND IN GAME ON GAME 4. THAT'S WHY HE IS MY FAV PLAYER
"Idk how many people said it before, but ima say it again.
KUNKKKKKKKKKAAAAAAAAAAA"
"It's so emotional, still today."
Topson's peculiar hero picks really was one of the most iconic moments in TI hahahaha just looking at the opponents faces after topson picks a hero the confusion hahahaha
Its almost time and Im rewatching this
2023 still coming back fot this
oct 2023
Watching it aa of the moment. I will be watching all these TRUESIGHTS til TI 12 starts. 🍻👌
38:48 already 2023 and still gives me goosebumps with this Ceb's play what a beast bro 🔥🔥🔥
"TI is coming guys! Still the best True Sight.

-2023"
"Everytime I watch this, it always reminds me of the difference between having a toxic teammates vs chill teammates. You'll know a team when they're falling apart if they start blaming each other instead of supporting their teammates. 😅"
Rewatched for 2023
I always comeback to all of ti true sights when the new ti is close to start.
"As an OG fan, TI9 was full of enjoy but TI8 showed me every different emotions that I can feel in the life 😂. I miss you notail"
"I remember watching the TI3 final and thinking no future Dota moment would ever come close to rivaling it. Alliance reaping their well earned reward for their mastery of the game was a triumph of the mind against an equally incredible Na`Vi who dared to give people far more hope than they should've reasonably been able to offer. Easily one of the greatest moments not just in Dota history, but in sporting history in general, the kind that inspires players and athletes no matter what they compete in. 

But even those competitors were and still are fans first and foremost. And what do fans want? A triumph of the heart, one where their hopes and prayers are seemingly magically answered. The kind that, as a human being more than anything, you look back on and understand that they are what make life so beautiful. And OG's at TI8 is certainly one of the greatest triumphs of that kind."
"I don't even play Dota2, but damn this is so beautiful. 
   am I late to try Dota2?"
OG .... All of you are the best forever.
"""Alright, Topson, is this guy for real?"" 😂😂"
Why topson seems so stressed out 😂
This is the best True sight.
like in the movies...arrogants always a looser at the end...
I watch it over and over again when I get bored until now. Best TI so far!!!
"Every year near TI, this is always a must watch"
"Im feeling so bad for Ame and Fy, despite the fact that og did great, i stiil do believe that LGD had to won that INT"
"i watch this ""movie"" every year no matter what. ti8 being the greatest comeback in history is what brings me back for more. i never fail to watch it again"
I really love this TI
9/22/2023 now and here I am still watching this masterpiece story of TI8 true sight
TI is closing in.. time to watch this masterpiece again
JERAX is my 🐐
2023 and I'm still here to enjoy this anime. Absolute the best anime of all time
Here to watch it once a year
❤
"most of the ""canadian"" crowd were all nicely integrated migrants with china flags, cheering the chinese teams despite having canadian players in ti"
The best Final
The stat lied 🐒🐒🐒
"If PSG would have done their homework and studied OG they would have been prepared for all the ""odd picks"" that they stumbled on. They clearly say multiple times that they dont understand what they are playing against. Probobly a life time lession on the game is already lost if you dont know who you are fighting."
tusk king LMFAO😂
This vs ti10 is the best
Greatest Ti
Still gives me goosebumps!!! WTF!
5 years ago....
52:51 JeRax's reaction ❤
tusks king? hahahaha what a joke fy
ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb!
"14:42 The way he said ""Kunkka"" Goosebumps."
2018 and 2019 TI IS THE BEST
38:37
Just admit it notail so genius for found the player. Topson first tournament
still having goosebumps till now.
The Problem with this chinese squad is they get to cocky when theyre up. They get to comfortable and start to relax and they never learned from their mistakes. 😂
I love how they didn't censor all the french trash talk xd
Ahhh nostalgia
When ceb said game 4 is his game. It really is his game.
"When I feel down, somehow I gain strength while watching this."
4 years ago im watching this 😭 best TI
"When I watch something on youtube and it ends, this is next on my autoplay. And I watch it again idc."
"Somnus, Fy and Chalice going into TI12 from China's wildcard spot. Good luck gentleman"
Best TI match
Hater says go watch true sight when OG loses. I am fine watching this legendary masterpiece once in a while.
"bro i love ceb even before the game started ""this is my game boys"""
"55:12 the face Notail makes knowing he's about to win TI makes me cry everytime, he deserves everything"
"These OG 5 men i always miss them 
And never forget that LGD team they deserve better in Dota"
Best true sight.. Still watching this for every TI coming.
"Still the best ti ever. 
Wow its at 15 m views now last time i check it was still at 2m"
2023 still watching this masterpiece ❤
This might be my favorite piece of esports media ever created.
Are lgd's subtitles correct?
Panahong buhatin pa si topson 🤣
remember psg. too much trash talk
"Ceb is a coach, captain, player, and the heart of OG. He is so dedicated to his team and teammates."
"When I'm feeling down, I somehow always find my way back to this masterpiece."
I'm here after the PSG.LGD vs Team Secret.
"Still watching this ohh mann! feels good looking at complete OG beast roster NOTAIL,CEB,JERAX,ANA,TOPSON still the best."
Imagine a team with ana collapse miracle jerax puppy in it .. imagine all that Gigachad moment they can show 🤤
17:40 n0tail smoking by the no smoking sign. Bad ass
"When I'm feeling down, I just watch Notail smoke on the Non-smoking Area. What an OG gangsta 😂🎉"
i keep coming back to this year after year. This is probably my favorite video on YouTube
"Every time I think something is impossible, I just watch these masterpiece-- Red Bull OG Documentary and TI8 True Sight. I'm going through a heartbreak right now and I'm reviewing for the board exams. I hope that I can do the impossible as well."
This is emotion train
"1 word that can describe this OG team is

TRUST

or 

BELIEVE."
August 2023 anyone?
This is the most stressful matches for me
"@44:05 ""lose together, win together, slay together, slay together, slay together"" What a statement"
Keep the tradition going boys
you cant deny fy is so good
"this is the most fulfilling TI final ever. rewatching it for  good vibes and good luck everyday, JerAx is the fucking best as always"
WHOS WATCHING IN 2023? What a classic..
"When ana said ""it doesn't matter"" he entered gmode"
2023 GANG!! WYA??
this shit is a masterpiece
when Roshan was in mid river
GG
I stop playing dota 3 yrs ago but I still love watching this TI8 truesight
W Ceb Mindset ❤❤❤❤
GO FIND A FRIEND LIKE CEB!
love the positivity of ceb
"Still amazes me that in a Game 5 of the finals, they just picked heroes that they wanted to play and won."
"in 59:25, NOtail looks like he's missing someone to hold the aegis together"
maybe arrogante
"Ceb is so positive. That's why sometimes when I play and everyone in my team is so cancer, I'd always think Ceb. Makes me calm and just tell them things that are positive."
Man this shit is emotional
52:13 lol what?
I keep coming back to watch the greatness that this true sight is.
2023 still got goosebumps to this
2023
must always watch this true sight each time TI is coming
"you can really see it in the gameplay, PSG LGD players were far better at playing Dota as individuals, but they got outplayed in the team game and mind game. On the other end ceb really held the team and dragged then through bad times by just encouraging them( and playing like hell as Axe when they needed him)"
Coming back to this before TI 2023
Proud to be og fans what did i hear go home og lol🤭🤣those sad face from the one who said that😂🤣
"@51:56
Chalice: We have to throw everything at them!
*Throws the game*

Thanks Chalice TI8 MVP!!!!"
Notail is badass. Smoking in a non smoking area 😂
whenever I feel down I watch this knowing this is the best true sight yet.
真得感谢AME这个畜生散失否决打猴子，下一年半决小狗BKB继续整蛊队友
I will always come back here and watch it all over again 💜 truly one of the best TI ❤️
TI is coming again. Just done watching it again and the goosebumps and motivation never changed. I really loved this series. And im sure all of you does too.  ♥️♥️♥️
TI is coming again. Just done watching it again and the goosebumps and motivation never changed. I really loved this series. And im sure all of you does too.  ♥️♥️♥️
Ti 8 and 9 best Ti for me💪🏻
back at it again 9 times already hahaha
Who's here? Rewatching it again HAHAHA
"Mates idk why I keep coming back to this and ti9 true sight, I just do, it a yearly thing."
Does anyone know what Ceb was saying at  31:00 ?
Invoker is counter by kunkka what an outplayed game
I have watched this numerous times and still amaze the fuck outta me.
i love it
"No matter how hard life gets, this always puts a smile on my face. Seems like the god himself wrote and directed this beautiful story and somehow we keep coming back to this. ♥️"
The scoring is godlike man
2023
Watching ti10 and the comments said that was the best true sight 🤡
Damnnn so satisfying to looks how those 🇨🇳 player faces after trash talking og 😌
"CEEEBBBBBBBBBBBB!
HE GETS THE CALL OF HIS LIFETIMEEEE!"
Greatest True Sight! TI8 OG is the definition of friendship.
"The best TI . The storyline, the comeback and the drama"
TI8 is the bestest TI ever xD
back again for the 4th time XD
Rewatching my all time favorite TI8
"2023, and this masterpiece still 🔥"
Ахуеть
Fly leaving OG and betraying Notail was a cannon event.
Is Gamin Gladiators team already active on this era?
I keep coming back here even after 4 years.
"I visit this every once in a while to motivate myself. But I never put myself in the position of LGD until I heard last year that this loss still haunts Ame ever since.
I’m not a fan of LGD nor Ame, never was, but I can relate to some level what Ame may have been feeling. I put myself in a position to win yet made a serious of bad decisions that led to my undoing. And as I failed I got to watch everything I’ve worked for slipped through my fingers like sand."
ame...
Damn can't remember how many times i watch this masterpiece 😆
"Man its been years and im here again....and that line from ceb.... ""we're getting tested, embraces it"" fuck sure as hell resonates to me"
"Hi it's me, im back again"
Og won the game 4 without ana knowing where the fck his hero at
JERAX ON THE ZONE IN GAME 5
Best  T1 story
Easily top 3 TI finals. Ti9 is good and TI7 BUT TI8 MAKE IT TO THE GAME 5 not only game 5 but series of full clutch of OG and Dominance of PSG.LGD specially in early game they dominate the game till the mid game. PSG.LGD have better players but OG is better team.
It's already 2023 and I still have goose bumps . This one is for Ceb.
"We remember, against the odds"
"By its time it was just an TI final, but more and more years go on I realize that was a historical moment."
It's always the TI7 And TI8 rewatch it once or 3 times in a year ❤
After losing 12 games in a row. I always watch this to lift up my spirit. Thank you so much!
Best true sight ever !!
I need Ceb to give motivation 👍
the best ti ever
Its 2023 right now but this is still worth to watch
"Here i am again, after all these years"
Reminder that this OG is the reason why they removed Open Qualifiers.
bro I've seen this true sight so many times and i can say THis PSG LGD and the OG are the best teams ever to exist man for real. I feel bad for the lgd guys they deserved it maybe not ti8 but on fcking Ti at least that roster was Godlike
Who's here watching this for the 50th time literally after these many years and still getting goosebumps!!
"My prediction is that there will never be better esport tournament documentaries than True Sight 2018 & 2019.
Ceb and N0tail are like the main characters of it, its almost like they won a tournament while shooting a documentary and not vice versa."
nandito naman ako para manood kasi malapit na TI sino mga kasama ko dyan .. 💕
Here again with my popcorn and soda ❤️
OGs story is what dreams are made of !
22:09 36:33 38:38 52:33 cinemetic
This is still the best TI ever !!!! PEAK
Anyone after the Bali major?
I only watch 3 maps of this final
Still best TI ever
"But on the other side, they find Ame. It still echoes in my mind evertyime"
"SHOW THE GAME, WHAT A BAD EDITION"
"“Win or lose, we don’t care, we play” - this is one of the most emotional quote ever"
"For some reason I always thought Ceb said: ""Lose together, win together, slay together, slain together, stay together."""
12:30 what is notail said ?!
came back to rewatch the best true sight with the best grand finals of dota!
55:37 Me at 4 am losing game in a ranked knowing I need to get up to work at 8
"Azure Ray lez go, bring Ame back for TI!"
Best Dota Match EVERR!!!
You might never notice this but OG's strength comes from Ceb eating a banana
always feels good to come back and watch this true sight
"Everytime I watch this I learn so much from this OG.
1. No matter what happens never leave your dream. There is still chance even in the direst situation.
2. Never be too cocky or overconfident in yourself. Underdogs are the most dangerous things in the world.
3. Never leave your friend in a messed up situation.❤❤"
"july 1 2023 still replaying it, one of the greatest TI"
"honestly this is probably the only timeline where og won. They fucked up more than LGD but anna carried hard. Story of dota, 4 and 5 cant outcarry a good 1. jerax did well but i dont think he could have won without ana"
"Love seeing the sad chinese faces at the end, they deserve nothing fk em"
Dammn ❤❤❤lovely love anya
Cebbbbbn
Topson's face 37:54 RuuUnnN ! 😂
"Tất cả những gì sau trận chung kết này là:
The fuckinggg pick!!!
The fucking buyback?!! 😂😂😂"
"Another one, still goosebumps. CEEEEEEB!!!!! i'm still crying the way they fought and no one believes them."
the commentator in the middle is making salty faces when OG starts winning and is so happy when OG losing. Ig he bet some money on LGD
Welcome back.
"Fy from
"" they dare to pick Axe in front of Tusk King ? ""

To

"" can we not draft like that ? """
"This is one of the best TI ever made.Still watching from Philippines ❤️
 (june 20,2023)"
41:50 song name of the piano in the background guys? anyone knows? lol.
"When I'm sad or down
I always come back here to get regen"
"that time, dota at its peak"
Ceb its real!
dog players
Watching in 2023 and this is still the best TI finals❤‍🔥
Long time no play dota but still come back here for the moment. RUTHLESS
BEST TI LOVE WATCHING IT AGAIN AND AGAIN
Really love to see team lgd suffer 😅
The best TI.. and I got its aegis!!!
"28:16, the moment where the awaited game starts"
ceb has the best attitude as coach and player until today
The best true sight ever!
I just watched this in my hospital time and it is somehow motivated.
"I hate somnus, i love how he get beaten"
"cant believe this is almost 5 years old now, its still the best TI to ever happen and the best true sight to ever be made, everytime i watch it, it feels like the first time and the emotions never change towards this, always an OG fan, the BEST TI to ever exist, ty valve."
Still feel the chills and emotions whenever I rewatch this
This is some top tier anime shit
Ceb let his teammate to play their hero
5:40 you can see the difference between toxic humans and people that actually enjoying what they do .
"it's already been 4 years and by watching this, still excites me."
TI is scripted
"watching lgd, they crying. feels bad man T_T"
"Valve really put effort to make this,"
PMA Team too broken *.*
"While I'm traveling, I watch this priceless moment of TI, no TI much better than this one. I feel both teams emotions and sacrifices of winning this series."
la mejor final de ti que pude ver hasta ahora
"This is PEAK dota! The moments, advantage swings and the god tier production, editing and music. N0tail's face at 55:13 when he realises they're just about to win it is sooo tearjerking. Such an absolute rollercoaster which we have the honour of being able to revisit."
And i am still Watching it 😂😂😂
fking jerax.. playing like not a bit pressure
"Cada cierto tiempo vuelvo a verlo en compañía de mis amigos, fue el mejor TI"
i mean im 27 year old now and everytime i watch it the tears fucking greatest team ever!.
that ending with notail gives too much fucking emotion man
2023 still ❤
This was thE best TI
"LGD: *picks literally any hero*
Ceb: OHH WTF ARE THEY DOING THEY FUCKED RN"
This underdog story of flowers and friendship will always give hope to literally everyone that will spent the whole hour watching this masterpiece.
"2023 anyone? The best TI ever! The drama is there, the struggle of qualifying for TI, unknown, unproven mid player, the comeback in game 5. Truly amazing!"
5:58 How Ana Pham differentiate my life rn.
30:58 to 31:03 can someone pliz explain what ceb said I wanna practice along with the text in france 😊.. I hope that was a franch slain word.
2023 but still this one is one of the best true sight ♥️
ALWAYS COME BACK//////////
"This particular TI has got to be the best finals in eSports history. Five lads from different parts of the world, forming a unit, being the underdogs; couldn't have written a more magical story than this. What a team!"
I love Somnus🔥 best mid player ✨
Best true sight
Hi future
"Watching this, b4 LAL vs GSW gm6 ok bye"
🔥🔥🔥
forever a masterpiece 🔥
"One of the best finals ever.
Even though I don't know much about the game but the emotions of the players and as well as the fans is just next level ."
psg should have won this. (i have less than 100 hours in the game)
"The intro of Notail always get into me, Dota is a sick mental game and indeed it is. The Best TI  no doubt about it."
Best revenge for the best team with the best enemies and the best years of dota
most satisfying win i ever witnessed. Got dismantle by Fy. But comeback real solid. 2018 was the best year .. not just them but world before covid. ❤
This always give me more hopeful
Cant even count how many times i rewatch this
Still the best true sight. The epic comeback from nothing to the champs.
I met notail today at the Berlin Major. Super humble guy.
.
Don't forget to watch Red Bull's extended documentary too..
"The way that ANAvsay ""its doesn't matter"" in game 4 loss is so much confidence that he sure that he will take his revenge .."
When ever I feel like im down I always watch ti8 n ti9 to get motivated...n it's always gives me a smile on my face❤️..2023 still watching..sad tat their no longer there😔
what a medicine this is
last game ember so good
PSG game 4 kena mental
"25:16 I dont know about you guys, but i feel like BigBoi jinxed it for LGD 💀💀💀💀"
Hands down the best DOTA team that ever existed.
MAN UP!
It's usually a tradition to watch this thrice a year
I miss the old patch
Without any question: THE BEST DOTA TEAM EVER!
"from time to time i keep watching this remembering myself this is dota, and dotes right now is just bad.. 😞"
LESSON LEARNED FROM GAME 5 NEVER EVER GIVE UP
Here I am again enjoying the best TI run and backstory imo.
18:18 what's that they're taking?
The chinese team really has no chill lol
Losing streak always brings me here.😅
This video has more views than the Half-Life Alyx Announcement Trailer.
"Win or lose, we don't care, we play. 

-Ceb"
Still the best true sight <3333333333333
After watching for the 10th time I just wanna say Ame and fy were fucked by their coach he coached bad he got too scared of a Spectre and as Ceb said “he feels bad for them” if they just stick to their guns and play like they did for the entirety of this tournament before this point they win TI.
they have to make a movie about this.
"Still feels great after 4 years, the only difference is I can feel the silence of PSG"
This goes beyond DOTA tbh. I visit this in the lows of my life and even in the highs just to remind myself that humility and hardwork goes a long way.
I don't even know they are but i'm crying in happiness watching them winning
Masterpiece
Dota 2 is the best game in the world
"When I'm feeling down, I somehow always found my way back to this True Sight."
"Every time OG plays, always have moment to remind how they Will always remember with watch this movie"
2023 and i still watch this history sometimes
2023 and i still watch this history sometimes
2023 and i still watch this history sometimes
55:13 that time he know It's for real ..... the best TI final
PL 25 GUYS 35:59 <3
"Commenting as I sit myself next to a toilet bowl while washing clothes on April 15, 2023. This video is so fucking epic, I'm feeling so hyped and motivated right now. I hope I can do something epic and great from this feeling."
Best TI fight ever
Checking in for 2023.
feel bad for ame
"LGD fans*go home OG! 
OG*sure!with aegis :) Lol."
LGD got so cocky and brought their own downfall.
"its 2023, but TI8 true sight still gives me chills"
"Never beats the feeling of playing dota and watching ti, I dont play dota anymore since the covid started but its a tradition to watch this once in a while. Tnx dota xoxo"
Should add in the Ana's EUL dodged echo slam but still the best TI ever!
55:35 fy looks like someone who didnt care about new year
Literal goosebumps everytime I watch this
here again after i saw the video of ame crying
Ceb's strong mindset is one of the big gest gift for team OG
25:16 - 25:28 got me HAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA
2023
2023 rewatched this because of AME crying on Somnus
come here again after Ame says sorry to Sommus for bad morph in game 4
Came back here because of Ame. Game 4 is one of the craziest game and biggest what if for psg lgd.
back here because ame still blaming himself for this loss :(( now this feels bittersweet
came back here after watching ame cried on a video telling sommnus his morphling is noob
"After what AME did at Somnus birthday, I watch this again 💔"
Who’s here after the video of ame crying to somnus
Came back to watch this bcos of Ame/Somnus recent drunk clip.
back here to watch why ame is crying coz of his morph
its really good to take look back how topson was so bad to become one of the best midlaner ever now.. so much improvements for him
Watching this after seeing Ame crying infront of Somnus
just wanted to watch it again Cuz of ame was emotional to somnus
whos here watching after seeing ame cried on his birthday while hugging and apologizing to somnus😢😢
LGD's blaming each other while OG's not giving a fuck if a teammate fucks up.
Came here after seeing Ame crying while drunk :<
"I came here because of Ame drunk crying on Somnus shoulder. Man still got ""Haunted"" by their lost in this TI Final."
"Even after TI8 ended for almost 5 years already, Ame still can’t get over from this Game 4."
"Do you guys know why this TI8 is one of the best? Because PSG LGD is too busy saying OG is stupid, dumbass etc. and their chinese fans are too proud saying OG GO HOME and then boom, stupid PSG LGD lose and OG goes on to become the first team to ever win TI 2 times (back-to-back) so yeah, IN YOUR FACE LGD"
This should be movie
damn I want Ceb to be my GYM coach.
Ahh look! I’m back for the 27th time
The best TI series
ODPixel is the True Sound
40:30 Why are there two guys with the same nickname?
i still love the scene when notail laughing with no reason
as you can see Notail seems to be in so much pressure his face says it all.. but watch ti9 and see the diff... CEB being giga chad throughout this freaking journey.. Love OG Man.
"This is the best freaking TI, no doubt. Been rewatching it for many times already"
I dont get why some people called them winning a fluke i mean try doing it from the start of the tournament untill the end . How is that a fluke ?!
I watch this when i felt burn out this is best video on the YouTube ❤
"PSG lgd had very low morale. When og players fell behind and was getting killed again and again, Ceb and Notail kept on motivating everyone. But when PSG lgd got killed, they all got demotivated and no one tried to uphold their confidence"
the best TI
Still watching 2023
2023 rewatching it again. its the best Ti ever
5:31 who is that guy that touching notail shoulder?
Imagine just imagine a guy which can't see his own hero and still winning TI twice in a row. Damn
TBH there is a very small screen time on AME on this truesight.
there's no better feeling than to see chinese dogs lose in the grand finals <3
Coming back here for the 69th time 🗿
"Another one, still goosebumps 😢"
"i still find it funny how Anna say ""Shit"" at 57:06 hahahaha"
Watching this rn before Ceb comeback
The moment when Ceb gets pissed and he picks Axe... lovely to see his confidence and his team mates support! <3
legend says anna still looking to find his PL lol!!!!!
"Came here to say that I've rewatch this video multiple times but today I was with my girlfriend that has zero knowledge with game and she love it so much that she proceeded to watch t19 true site all by herself. The story of OG brings wonder even for those that's outside the dota2 community. 


I felt like a proud father💐☺️"
i dont play dota but im still watching this lol! still the best True Sight for me
"""Win or Lose we don't care, We Play""

As I captain, This is my go to phrase every game and saved me so many times. All the clutches, losses and all the moment that pays off because it changes me and our teams mentality. Thank you OG."
"how many times i watch this and i still wanna watch it..yes still the best true sign
the best version of OG!!"
Now we're back here because some Jerax guy created an OG team for DPC reg
"Fans: ""go home og""
Og: ""with aegis"""
"this 5 years a goo , times fly so fast."
It’s a one month tradition for me you “tradition foke”
The best True sight ever
Its 2023 and still watching this.
"5 years since OG win their first Aegis.. and this True Sight still make me cry..
WHAT A LEGENDARY TEAM!"
came back again.... ( i lost count already)
"hands down, the best TI and Truesight everrr"
what is the song at 43:00
"Everytime i watch this TI8
I want to like this video again n again n again."
"46:05 7ckngMad: No matter what is is, we're going to fucking destroy them.

Bro is 1,000% a team player."
"Fluke no fluke 
Ti no Ti
Og no Og
Best true sight ever"
"What is so distinct about TI8 is about the players in OG making a comeback from 1 match away from being the champion. Ceb continue to give them hope. A hope, a dream, an idea, and that became reality for them being the champion. This will be my favourite TI."
That once in a while has come. Reporting from 2023. Hands down still the most inspiring life story ever .
"""I strongly believe that if I woke up in the morning and I had to play the TI final, I would play the best Dota of my life, and that's all that would matter to me. My very best, nothing else would matter."""
Peak Dota.
Here we go again. Shall we?
Jerax laughing for Ceb's french curses is priceless..
2023 
UP
The story of og is so inspiring in real life too....
"""THE BEST DOTA 2 TRUE SIGHT"" even in now 2023"
Y
best true sight and best team!
I love this game ♥️
"I lost my motivation to do my thesis even though tomorrow's the deadline. Thanks for the motivation, Ceb🌻"
"I am watching this LEGENDARY TI18, 20 or more times! Feeling like watch first time! We never forget you best team OG: Ceb, Ana, Topson, JerAx and Notail!!!"
Every dota player dream this💓
When you think about China giving you Covid... watch this crushing defeat to make yourself feel better.
I feel like yesterday.
2023 chingChong
2023 anyone?
2023 anyone?
watched it again hahaha wheres my buddies at ? :)
2023?
"This is the reason why so many love dota, ""WIN OR LOSE, WE PLAY AND HAVE FUN""❤"
Go fckn ember i trust your fckn ember
Easily esports best moment ever the story everything
"Even after rewatching it hundreds of times I'm still so impressed by Ceb's motivation. Gets me every time. In my opinion he is the best player of all time, maybe not the most skilled, but counting teamplayer, motivator, caller leader and solid player himself he is just unique"
Rewatching this because Blaclist lost LOL
"""Mute them"" classic og harass"
Iconic .
Beat ‘The International’ of all time. I think I’ve watched it 12x already. It’s become a tradition to como watch it once in a while
"This was the best TI finals ever.
The drama, intensity, pressure and gameplays are on a different level. I never played dota 2 but I understand how it feels to win."
2023 who's here with me bois
In the best international of the history dota 2 !!!❤❤❤❤
"still the best Ti true sight and grand finals .
the story of both teams
excitement..joy..pain.. commitment..and their passion for the game,its all there. 

Seeing this true sight brings nostalgia for all the fans who loved this amazing game."
True Sight is what I want f1 drive to survive to be
"Anyone noticed JerAx being emotional at 52:52? And n0tail's ""OH MY GOD, is this seriously happening?"" face at 55:13."
9:45 What was that face man. Caster taking it too seriously while the other two is just loosing their minds.
Was the shoulder massage is about crit bump notail?
The best ESPORT story.
Ceb is a legend
me in newyear 55:36
"Dota 2 is a menace to human beings.
Writing this comment I am pretty calm and thoughtful so dont judge fast, If I had the power, I would K.I.L.L everyone who has played dota 2 obsessively, why? what do you do to a abusive group of people who have been making others suffer and depressed ? and you get in this group willingly, that s how sick your mind is.
Dota 2 players are both victims and criminals who suffer themselves and suffocate others, after joining dota 2 community you will hate human beings, what harm greater than this? (for those who wanna educate me after this: stfu I'm a toxic piece of shit, u expect me to hear u? sadge"
7:20 hype music alibi crusading
Some minds are really hard to beat though🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
39:06 that discussion between Jerax and Ana : Peak Dota. You got to love it
I think this my favorite movie ever
Shy type topson HAHAHHAA
💖💖💖
"2022 and it's still watching this 
I think I haved watched this for 10x and still gives me chill 🔥"
4:39 sorry peeps i leaves this here cause his intro is so fucking hype i keep comming back to listen to it from time to time
"Really miss this OG lineup, I still think that they can 3peat if they have the same lineup for ti10."
"Every time I see this is STILL get an immediate huge emotional response to seeing n0tail at 55:13 have his little moment of realisation that they're ACTUALLY ABOUT TO WIN. Before that moment, it was all focus."
When I missing my friends Id just watch this ti8 and Og once in a while and I will feel relieve
Watching again to remind myself that this team is the best team to win TI
The best true sight.❤
"This will always be the best TI Grandfinal of all time, the battle between 2 Titans, a turning point of the West-East Tradition. These players will always be remembered."
"Once a week or month , by anyhow."
How much did money did OG win from this?
Its not your first time here and you know it
41:25 and it fucking was🥹
"55:13 i feeling his breath. Thinking a lot of things but game not ended, very complicated feeling @ the end Happy Ending 😭😱😬🤗."
"chinese literally ""you dare to fight tusk king, you court to death!"" just like their manhua lmfao
get jinxed tho"
48:29 that is why you always need a Ceb in your team he always think positive and never looses composure and trust to his teammates
its now 2022 but still the best TI ever period
Okay its tradtion Been Watched Hehe
N0tail's intro about the mental warfare is the truest shit that happens in this game.
In front of the tusk king? Lol
"I wanna do something rn, but I lack confidence. Need that ""MAN UP! F*IN MAN UP! WIN OR LOSE WE DON'T CARE WE PLAY!"" motivation speech."
"First thing to do if you are in a TI final:

Block & mute OG - its GG when the ancient explodes."
Incredible story
"this is great production value, randomly came across this true sight series and its very strong"
"Who's watching this in 2022?  6th time watching this, classic dota"
This OG line up run on TI8 and TI9 is still the best story on the history of DOTA 2. The only run that can compare to them is probably NAVI's run on T1 and T2 against unstoppable China's powerhouses.
39:14 hahahaha I cant even see my fucking hero hahahhahahahaha ANA legit hahah
F*ck short vids on yt. Brings me back here
"LGD every game ends = stress
OG = chill. 

og is getting on their heads."
watching this again and the amount of cuss words lgd players used were imcomparable to just of chingchong. and they got what they deserved haha. 😂
气啊
"no matter how good you are, you need to pay for dota 2 programmers to make you win, and if you don't, you'll get bots that hurt your games :-)"
Best way to get back in to DOTA. Just watch the True Sight series. Gg
I will never get tired watching this ❤️
it's 3am and i chose watching this again & again after having a bad day.
"Ceb: This might be an axe game
Me thinking: You have no fucking idea"
"I have been a fan of n0tail since his HoN days, and I believe he is hands down the most impactful person in the entire game. How many people came from OG into the professional scene? Miracle, ana, topson.. his phrasing, the way he views the game. A true legend to me. Huge respect my guy."
Lgd failed because command of chalice so blunder
"Coming back to watch this again, (as is tradition), I think PSG.LGD noticing that Ceb is holding a bunch of papers is a key moment.
While I can't speak for the reality of the situation since I haven't followed DotA like most people, the fact that a professional player found it odd that the coach was holding a bunch of papers tells me that the level of research OG had going into this game was a little bit unprecedented, and based on what I've seen in the most recent True Sight documentaries it definitely changed the landscape of professional play when it comes to analysis and preparation before a tournament."
"TI8, TI3, TI6, TI5, TI9."
"I'm still watching this in 2022. And still it gives me goosebumps. The moment ana said ""it doesn't matter"" in @23:57 the OG power awakes."
we cry and get inspired from their winning as we all knows what the drama the team need to went through when their teammates ripped apart by EG
This  music and moment when Ana buy back on Amber....omg I got goosebumps every time I watch it - I mean it blockbuster on itself
God i miss jerax
"BES TI EVER.. The underdog, who is topson?, getting into the TI from qualifier, ceb become player, betrayed by fly, and anything else u can add it by replying my comment"
Still the best TI ever
This is the team that made me play Dota 2! Been playing ever since this True Sight.
Kunkka..
Just here for my monthly ritual... Onto TI9 True Sight next 😊
I feel more emotional watching this compared to the recent true sight. This win just hits different.
Funny how ame didn't say a single word for 1hour video.
im with n0ta1l <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
idk how many times i've watched this now its been 2 years especially since ti11.. worst ti ever.
team spirit's story>og's story
"Notail is the perfect example of ""just enjoy the game"""
TI11 just ended. Time give this one a good rewatch.
Prime Psg Lgd and Prime Og Team is one of the best Ti you could ever ask
"THIS IS THEEEEEE BEST TI EVER, PERIOD."
Someone Make this an ANIME PLEASE
True Sight 18&19 is a masterpiece
2022 still watching
"Start of Game 5 in the Grand Final of TI and n0Tail says ""Been ready for a long time."" - chills"
Who's waiting for this year's Truesight ?
coming back here after the garbage of ti11 finals
I prefer this than TI 11 is garbage
"Смотря на то, какой вышел инт 2022, стоит ещё раз пересмотреть лучший Интернешнл в истории доты. Красивый, интересный, с отличными комментаторами. Эмоции и настоящая борьба."
Bravo l'europe nique ta mere avec ton shaker
Back to watch this after TI11. TI8 is still the best TI ever!
coming here after disappointing TI this year
This was 4 years ago and still better than today's TI production
Back here for the 4th time now. Still getting goosebumps!
39:43
Ceb biggest moment I can't just ignored it
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb!
I love watching this especially Ceb's speech. #DreamOG
"i come back again here, thinking this wont affect me at all, still crying at the moment OG wins and when i hear N0tail with her tears how joy, knowing every, fcking hard moments he had until that moment.


The best International from DOTA we ever had, on history"
ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
Feels good to watch this again TI8 and TI9!
Watching this video while I’ve been stuck queing all random for 30 minutes
"u know whats the same thing between LGD and Liquid?
They both underestimated.
LGD underestimated OG and Liquid underestimated themselves."
it is like a fucking movie i swear
"They dare to pick axe in front of tusk king??
Rest is history…"
"Whenever I need some sort of motivation, I'll come back here listen to Ceb's speech."
latest true sight looks a lot shittier than this one imo
"The combat at roshan pit has changed the game. And the fact is Kunka failed his combo to disable Magnus, dis-connected with TB, moving back and forth and blocked by Notail micro skills. He might wanted to take rosh as it's low hp, but then couldn't decide to kill the rosh or to help TB. He literally did nothing in this combat."
"I love OG, but watching Fy after defeated in game 5 is realy heartbreaking. He is a solid legend and deserves a TI win."
Beautiful Dota!
I hope to see another OG true sight in my lifetime. Wish ti11 was different...
"I cant imagine but how the hell they won the final game using whatever they wanted like if jerax had said, i want to use courier hero then no tail would have said, ""yeah, fuck it lets go"" And they would still win hahsh.
This was 110% written in the stars for OG."
wow
still TI 8 is the best cause power of flower and friendship
"This where dota 2 focuses on the players experience hyping the fans, now it all becomes money milking, greedy developers, and garbage battle pass recycled immo and mediocre items, which includes more chat wheel in every level and spray sticker, more persona and arcana was forgotten and it is impossible to purchase unless you buy more level not like the old days that you can purchase it of out market. 🤣🤣🤣"
52:00
"Ti8 still the best TI ever, can't stop replay this movie..."
"LGD ALL THE WAY, STILL HOPING FOR EACH OF THEM TO LIFT THE AEGIS!!"
19:43 agreeing 😂
"dayum feel sorry for LGD MAN. Just look at em 
they are 1win away from aegis ti8"
"Rewatching for the Nth time. Don't just talk about The Cinderella story of OG, let's also talk about the persistence of these LGD guys"
It's more painful watching Somnus and xNova suffer a loss after their run at TI11.
"Truly the greatest TI game , TI story, i mean everything. Truly beautiful"
"Had to watch this before witnessing another team lifting the Aegis.
Will always be my favorite TI 🔥"
"After just 1 hour of watching TI11 i knew i will back to this. This is peak DotA2, this is peak e-sports & and considering what i see this year, i don't think this will ever be repeated."
"yg paling menikmati moment ini si JerAx, calm bener cuk ekwkwk 🔥🔥"
17:41 Let's respect the law!
MASTERPIECE.
blabber
i am playing finals today in league of legends with my team ....i am rewatching this to get the mental i  need to win...love to og <3
Watching this before TI 11 starts.
watching this  a day before TI11
"On my annual rewatching, today's reflection is that in any competition, if there's a winner, there's also a loser.  Don't get so caught up in your winning, or your team's winning, that you forget the folks on the other side.  It makes me wish major tournaments like this would make more space to include the second-place and runners-up in the celebrations, instead of largely relegating them to consolation prizes (of a few million dollars...)  Like, even if you lose the finals, being second-best team in the entire world out of 18 teams that placed and countless teams that competed in group stages and Majors is still an incredible accomplishment and deserves praise, too."
"Jerax will always be the winning piece in OG's success here and TI9. I wish more light was shed on him during this truesight. His calls, forcing his team to make the plays they need to make, but might be too scared to make. He really, truly is amazing. Jerax God"
30 38 lakad mtatag
"Damn, it must have been electrifying to be a crowd on this TI. I've watched this for few times now but I still get goosebumps from the cheers when OG wins the clash. Ceeeeeeeeb!! he really owns that Game 4!"
Its the best true sight
Men I feel goosebumps every I watch this legendary game .... The goosebumps never erased
49:46
i know OG is main highlight in this true sight but man Somnus and chalice interactions were hilarious XD. you know they are good friends
I can watch this again and again..❤️
I just love when OG doing celebrate and look the face of PSG LGD wkwkw
"That 'win or lose, we don't care we play by ceb. So cold man."
"37:30 My favorite comment of the whole video is Jerax ""Ana you want to relo into the base? Memes?""
Ana ""Fuck off""
Jerax ""Bye bye""

Classic 😂"
The Best True Sight I've ever watched
Is no one going to point out that this is oceans 11 level crew building story?! Ana I got a job for you. Notail? You son of a bitch
if this lgd got ame form inti21 may it can win that ti8
每看一次，心热一次，Good job OG
i wonder when the cameraman records the losing teams walk away how the losing team must be feeling looking at the camera in front of them it just feels so weird
"Я, конечно, уже смотрел этот тру сайт. Но Себ на драфтах такой высокомерный, после гг сидит и ебалом щёлкает. Они победили, молодцы, после ещё раз взяли эгиду. Но, всё же, европейцы ебанные"
can anyone give me the time stamp of when notail talks about sweatpants? thanks
54:44 who is this ?
STILL THE BEST TRUE SIGHT
"URGENT MESSAGE !!!
JESUS IS COMING SOON !
REPENT AND ACCEPT HIM AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR FOR YOU TO BE SAVED.
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
John 3:16 NIV 

GOD BLESS EVERYONE ! ❤"
It has become a tradition to watch this once in a while
Because of what happend to wings no chinese team will win TI
The cringes guy i ever seen
this is the best true sight
Somnus the goat
ti10 is nothing than this
"here after watching TI10 true sight, still the best TI finals ever"
I'm a league of lengends player but t really like true sight
TI8 hits different than TI10. Saw the latter and there's something lacking. I watched this and it made me complete. TI8 and TI9 are the best!
55:37 the guy behind overthinking of fireworks.
Who else here to get motivate?
"39:16

""I don't even know what the fuck is going on, I haven't even seen my own hero.""

- OG.Ana, top 1% of 1% of all dota players."
I really watch almost a hundred times.. I'm a solid OG fan but i wanna give Ti to Ame this time.. he seems a good guy.. and a quiet one..
I think im at my lowest point in my life rn but watching this reading the comments motivates me and give me hope. This is hope. This is what life is. This story of og is just perfect example of how people should never give up and there’s always chance to turn thing round. I know i will be reading this comments maybe a year or two later maybe 5 years. After i succeed in life and remember how hard the things was but only thing that matters is I didn’t stay on the ground i got up
I still watching it whenever I need motivation
I love this moment 59:27 no tail just hugging the aegis
"i dont play or watch dota on a regular basis but the TI is something different, its just hits u, and this final was something extra ordinary!"
This TI8 Finals never failed to give me goosebumps. Every time I watch this i get so fvcking excited.
HAHAHAHAHA GG CHINA
Jerax was always the key player for OG in Ti8 and Ti9. The man is a genius at pos4.
"When Ana said ""It doesnt matter"" we all know he'll f them all up on the remaining games."
"TI8 will always be the best TI ever. Notail redeemed himself after his bestfriend left him, Topson got recruited at the last minute, and OG winning TI the hard way. It’s that time of the year again hoping for the new OG squad to blossom."
GG
14:43
"Still the best True Sight. Storybook ending. Full of drama. I was cheering for VP this TI.

True Sight 2021 was dull as heck for me personally."
"39:58 wtf, that's Topson speaking?"
"WHENEVER I FEEL UNMOTIVATED PLAYING DOTA, I JUST WATCH THIS AND IM BACK IN MY GOOD STATE OF MIND"
Topson is for real
"51:11 if only they listened to xnova call, maybe they can win this TI"
I watch this every year before Ti.
Just came here to enjoy a cigarette with big daddy
Coming back here after watching TI 10 True Sight. Paying homage to the legendary OG zero to hero run
This OG isn’t just the greatest because of their titles. They’re the greatest because they are everything that is so great about exports.
CEBBBBBBBB
"After Sight TI10, this Sight still the best"
Okay it's time to watch the best TI again this time of the year
"The rivalry, the intensity. This Truesight has all the elements you can ever look for"
"Don't mind me, just preparing for the new True sight."
my boys <3
"""Do you think Ember is still good?""
One decision can change your life."
2k22?
Ah shit here I am again watching this masterpiece
Still get the chills man
27:00
46:02
46:03
"2022/09/23, Now I finally have the immune to LGD.PSG's tragedy after 2018-2019-2020. Soon True sight TI10 will come, and now I am ready to watch True sight 2018 2019.................TAT"
goks... solid banget yhh
OG cамая эпичная команда за всю историю доты!
1:02 Sumailllll <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
It just became a tradition where we watch the best TI before watching the current TI.
Keep the tradition alive bois
Dahil dito tumaas na yung expectation natin every TI hahaha nostalgic kasi talaga
45:55 awh topson
"September 2022, anyone with me ?"
PSG has the bad guys vibes😂😂
"31:47 ""foot sock"""
"This True Sight I've Been Watch More Than 10x Times..
But Everytime I watch back , I'll Still Goosebumps.
Can't wait to watch Team Spirit VS LGD"
this Ceeeeeeeeeeb moment
🎊🎊🎊 OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGGGGGGGGGGGG 🎊🎊🎊
honrando la tradición de todo buen Dotero
this OG was and will always remain my fav but man 55:36 this is where my heart melted and I couldnt stop my tears.. damn
Time to rewatch the best ti there is🔥🔥🔥
"OG Team is the best team to win the TI competition
They really deserve this"
I love when Sommnus says Kunkkaaaaa
Who's watching again this time? 9:38 PM 21/09/2022 Ph time
"Announcer: Topson, is this guy for real? He's like nothing before this. (LAUGHS)
Now he's definitely something AFTER this."
"28:56 Ceb: ""This is my game boys"" 
38:48 ""Ceeeeeeeeeeeb!!"""
Never get bored watching this❤
2022 True sight is coming
i'm here again for the nth time. Still the best TI in history for me 🥰❤️
It's time of the year again to rewatch this masterpiece of a story.
只能说太可惜 最接近的一次
"I just feel bad for LGD at this point, they should get a TI title at this point"
Just popping in to watch the greatest story of all time again.
TRADITION TO WATCH ONCE IN A WHILE
"Fucking end the gane😄

I feel you bro. Jerax you beautiful f*😎"
💀
for you
Still one of the best TI FINALS.
"i dont know wtf going on, i can't even see my hero.

oh yeah thats made my day lol"
Magnus fucking PSG LGD since ages
I cant wait for ti10 truesight!!!
History of Ti 18  &  19 OG 👽and not forgetting  team Liquid 🔥
Im here again with this 10/10 anime
"Before TI11 comes, here I am watching this wholesome vid"
Back to the tradition of watching this epic memory!
GREATEST TI OF ALL TIME!!!!
"Honestly, I have 0 clue of Dota but this LGD coach is not the guy you want to lead your team, thats for sure"
CEEEEEEEEEEEB!!!! Gave me goose bumps
IT IS A TRADITION BEFORE TI11
Ti 11 qualifiers is about to end. I need to do this tradition for once in a while 😁
"if you take a look at 56:14 - 56:20 seems like it is foreshadowed that they will win TI again next year, it is the color of the theme if TI9."
i felt bad for fy
40:21 the smile that jerAx have.
It's nature for Dota fans to rewatch this true sight every year. What a story. <3
"TI 11 is near, time to re watch this one again"
"When you watched the state of how they enter the arena, the game is over."
"50:45 look at the referee at rhe back of jerax, looks like his watching ana if he's gonna make it then his reaction was, ""Holy shit"" hahaha"
Again watching this get me goosbumps in 4 minuts. What a team.
"Mix emotion 🥺, I feel bad for fy and ame but the same time I'm glad OG win"
Oh yeahhhh
Fairy tale at its finest🥰
spam this flower to give BigDaddy power
suiiiiiiiii
they say its just a game....
i love notail he needs to be protected at all costs
"Тупой китаец говорит что хорошо разменяли эгиду ,на байбек, хпхпахпаххапах и проиграл из за этого игру"
"Man, this brought me to tears."
This gives me literal chills everytime <3 love the OG bois
Once again....
"Its the time of the month again for The internationals. I miss this OG line up. I guess every good things comes to an end. For this year, I will be rooting for T1!"
that extra guy in their booth has tenacious D pizza guy vibes
https://youtube.com/channel/UCiIO8uSpTsUrAlx1V8dBrOg
i really hope the continue to make these true sight series!
"Damn, only somnus, chalice and xnova are still together fighting for the qualifiers.

On the other hand, can't really imagine topson and ana playing for SEA in the same team. Wish them goodluck on qualifiers too."
legend
Yeah... The greatest TI with full stadium crowd without fucking masks... Miss those times...
thefact is LGD will never win a final
pov: you stopped playing dota but still watches TI
One of the best TI's ever
"It's that time again, TI is closing in and It's time to watch the greatest story in history."
2022 and still watching this. Damn.
Go home LGD go home LGD ? 😉
"That's how you play DOTA! All OG players especially CEB really knows how to play DOTA. They just ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF THE GAME! They don't much care about the strategy, they don't care about picks, just pick whatever you feels! OG is just really enjoying the game while LGD is focus only in winning. NICE GAME!!!!"
"September 8, 2022 and I'm watching this again, same feeling like it happens just yesterday. <3"
The fights in game 4 were the most epic out of all TIs!
look at there emotion feel it :( 54:44 and this moment too 40:19
That must be the best feeling in the world
I have watch it like a thousand times..cant tell this is the best felling ever for them..
Topson telling Ceb it’s real is one of the best moments in esports history. Definitely the most wholesome
Does it have the repeat step sequencer in the step sequencer ??
"fy deserved to win... the best four lost( He did everything to win all 5 games...he won the start of every game, which is what the 4 should do."
"Dame I feel bad for LGD... despite the despare they didn't call GG, they had hope that something may happen. This shows their yearn to be a Ti winner"
"You are by far the best teacher for soft soft . It's very complicated at first - overwhelming, actually - but, you make it doable for"
"“Who has a better late game timing?”
‘We do because we’re better’ 

What a chad"
"Gettin close to TI, time to watch all these again for the millionth time 🤣🤣"
"they are incredible, love Ceb for being so inspiring they dont care about losing or winning, they are just focusing on the game with som much attention"
"6:33 ""Holy crap, Ceb is holding a bunch of papers"" 😄"
Watching this AGAIN every month
"Valve, i'm still waiting for TI 10 TRUE SIGHT!"
What kind of new pop-ups they are talking about on that Battle Pass page?
Tusk King my Ass 🤣🤣🤣
Death Gaze mode my Ass 🤣
12:42 NOT TODAY HAHA
the best ti team ever in history
54:45 iyak c ate haha! 😂
ive made it a point to binge watch all true sights before the new one gets released. this one is still my favorite.
It is a tradition to watch this before every TI.
41:45 :>
27:49 if only they give the Centaur maybe they have more chance to win. The axe pick made the difference.
wtf is wrong with the quality????? Somebody was filming from monitor. Totally unwatchable
who is cutting onions here?
LEGENDARY MOMENT
🤣😂 ana some shit 57:09
this chalice is so cocky
Idk why I never know who is the coach of og they never say his name or relationship prior he just ...appears jajajaj
That game 5 was the beginning of OG's aggressive playstyle that dominated the pro scene the later year
"55:38 saddest shit ever, you can literally feel them"
why am i crying again and again...
54:45 🥺
best TI EVER
The perfect example of breaking the minds of your enemies. OG got dumpstered game 2 and 3 and didn't break. PSG broke after game 4.
"notail at game 5: ""i've been ready for a long time."" i felt that"
39:05
Just keep coming back everytime new OG loses so that we remember how great this team was 💪🏻💪🏻
Whenever I need motivation...
TI8 grandfinal  highlights = Ceeeeeeeeeb
"Ahh shit here we go again, again, again, again"
"Watching Aug 22,2022 @5am"
"When i like to give up, i watch this masterpiece everytime, to remind me , sometimes it just a little obstacle before glory."
So inspiring and well put together. Keep it up. Love it
"Dumped by girlfriend, dog died, worst of all, betrayed by his best friend. Came back as TI champs back2back. What a legend!"
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB!!!!111
"56:10 Topson, ""We won TI! We won TI!"" Now he's back in 2022! Godson, Topson, T1son."
what a cinderella story
Невероятно эпично
watching it again ☺
this is so beautiful 🥲
TUSK KING
while waiting for the latest truesight. time to rewatch this
Time to re-watch this before the Truesight:TI10!!!
"Rewatching this before True Sight next month.  And still holds up. Probable one of, if not the best, Dota 2 Finals ever."
IT IS A TRADITION THAT WE WATCH THIS ONCE IN  A WHILE (2)
Since the newTrue sight will be coming soon. Just need to watch this again as a tradition.
sept 26 huh
Re-watching before ti10 true sight releases.
Here I am again watching the best TI so far for the nth time.
กลับมาดูกี่รอบก็ชอบ
"LEGENDS ARE BACK!(topson&ana) @T1 ..AUG. 16, 2022"
Who's here rewatching this because excited for the upcoming true sight of Team Spirit? 😂
meeraindri
"52:14
All the Chinese watching this had their mouth open all the time, like their waiting for a fruit or aegis to drop in their mouth."
This is my kind of motivational video when I'm losing my hope. OG's story affects people beyond DOTA 2.
I love watching the Chinese audience choke after the match so quiet
What is the music at 42:16?
38:48 CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBB!!!!!!
KUNKAAAAAA
Hello I'm new to this game and I don't quite understand about the rosh fight in game 5? Did LGD make a mistake? 😅
I just keep coming to this for inspiration
The best team ever created.
"I have never played Dota 2. I have only played League of Legends. But man, after seeing clips of this mini movie at FB, I was amazed by the whole story of OG. Much respect to this team and their overwhelming mental fortitude and finesse skills. Notail, Ana, Topson, Ceb and JerAx."
I'll always come back to this TI 🔥
This tournament really is a lesson for psg lgd . Looking down on their opponents . That’s why it’s a curse to them even until ti10
"fat dude really did jinx them hahahahahaha, didnt  see him attt any events after that"
"Topson 2018: "" I don't know??"" (what to pick)
Topson 2019: ""I got Diffu"""
Watching this again because TI10 is still not out.
Let the yearly tradition kick off again… Watch this before TI
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB!!
"so sad for team PSG LGD, GGWP"
"I kinda wanna watch this old OG lineup vs. the new OG lineup like its fathers vs. sons, juniors vs. seniors"
35:57 what a moment
Watch this every year is like a tradition
I might’ve watched this like some 50 times already
its 2022
"Feel bad for lgd, always crushing every team but losing in finals"
This is best ti ive ever watch and this is my 100th timez HAHHhH
these guys are good I hope they win the one after this
"55:36 - 55:50

Holy Sh*t, that's heartbreaking"
"When you unlike the video because you thought that you can do a double like
Proceeds to triple like"
2022 and still watching
Just hat off for cinematic moment with ceeeeeeeeeeeb. So Epic.
This film just better then any Holywood blockbsuter.
"Team spirit won this TI. Just no other team like OG, absolute team synergy, no weakest link, no pointing fingers. Notail and Ceb just made this atmosphere. I believe, that LGD had better players. But to have that kind of relationship in a pro team, when millions of dollars was on stake? To really be able to play for fun under all this pressure - just miracle."
It's 2022 and Ceb's Axe on Game 4 still gives me chills. What a series!
30:56 😏🇨🇵
55:40 🧝‍♂️
"idk why but its now becomes a habit that i would watch this before ti start😂 like other comments said, it become a tradition ig"
Watching before arlingon
Poor PSG just cannot win TI even with FY on Form..
Jerax mvp.
"LGD at every point is at its best.. Like every position, they dominated, but somehow OG persevered and won... Pretty cool story for the underdogs"
masterpiece
Im a fan of bigdaddy since fnatic days and once dream to play at this stages and dream to win TI but now its so impossible to me since I have a severe cancer and dying from it but as a fan of bigdaddy Im happy for him that he already succeeded in his dream to win TI not 1 but 2 in a row ( Im sorry for my english I know its bad but its understandable XD)
ti10 true sight pls
2:44 what is he hiding lol
"My favourite part of international,i wish you best of the best ,live dota !!dota is the best game !!!!!!"
Somnus “Crap Ceb is Holding A Bunch of Papers” And that's how they knew they fucked up hahajahajjajaja
Kunkka
"Welcome to site,place what to active in change base,

 Pwde na kayo Sumali sa battle of YouTubers originals
Line phillipines, SORORITY/fraternity now patch clans and our society.AE caravan flags race 22/16_08-30 great life ended! Game life,bersed in book of 100pisos."
"I call this the very definition of ""The Jinx"""
成王败寇
"Come here everyonce in a while to be happy for OG boys, to cry happy tears. Best Grand Finals BO5"
Is that w33haa? @11:31
so much in memory
is there anybody watching after the announcement of Ana playing with RNG?
36:53 - Ceb looks like Leonidas from 300 while destroying PSG.LGD
Alright guys! See you again next year!👌
here I am again for  the nth time. this was history
this is The FUCKING rock 1 from the game's universe
Its a tradition that i watch this once in a while
anyone here rewatching this from 2022? 🙋🏻‍♂️
"That is a fucking strong team, Go Ahead OG!
YOUR fan from Uzbekistan!!?!"
yup definitely jinxed it
0:36 if only fy would have watched Notail interview at this moment ..no cap LGD would have won Ti8
TI8 and TI9 is the best game for OG it's CEB's positivity won this game and Jerax strategies that is why it's always support and tank is the winning key
How Topson destropyed mid in Upper Bracket final to being scared - experience is real thing
"Ceb this is my game, best axe play in the TI imo"
still watching this after riyadh masters. im just missing these memories
Watching this after LGD beat  OG on RIYADH MASTERS lol
feel like watching movie
He fucking jinxed it!🙄
Rewatching this diamond again🤣💎
That game 5 when they picked what they were feeling and not what should be picked
anyone know the song from 34:56?
這裡有台灣人嗎？
"Have to watch this again after hearing Ana will be having his part-time work, but for Liquid this time."
"watching this 2-3 times a year, still laughs hard at: ""dare to pick Axe infront of the Tusk King?"" 🤦‍♂"
"Seb is such a hype man, him and Notail are really good leads 🥲"
41:49
teams that win game 1 always lose the finals🤣🤣🤣
You can see the passion No Tail had at every up and down in the series. The Heart that Fly Never Had
i watch this evertime i feel sad
When teen gamers makes more money then world class athletes
Waiting here for new true sight
Fly - still looking for the aegis.
"Guys don't watch this game and then go back to dota if you're playing solo queue, their opponent is the enemy but their allies remain their allies. You're enemies with your opponent but your allies turn against you at a whim. Most players in dota are above 20 and have real life problems, your game don't matter to them like these players playing the tournament.

They're not there for the game, but to get a small win after being beaten down in life. As a teammate, either you give them the in-game one-sided abusive win they came for or become a free online psychiatrist for them to unload on.  Losers like these stops at nothing to get the win they came for, one way. Or another. You're playing a different game than what you were playing when you're a teenager. Take it from somebody who returned multiple times only to be met with disapointment. I'm divine 2 and peaked at 5, the only bracket I haven't played and cannot speak for is immortal."
This True Sight is better than sex.
OG's midlaner is....

Still waiting for TI10 True Sight
"2 TI finals for LGD and 0 wins as of TI 10. Argueably the best team in the world over the year, but also the best chockers in the world.
EU wins: 6 [4x WEU, 2x EEU(CIS)], China: 3, NA: 1.
China hasn't won a TI since TI6."

Best TI 🌻
"bro I don't even play dota2, but this TI gives me the chills and it just inspires me so much. <3"
"guys, there is no true sight 2021 ?"
"I cried when ana said ""ceb its real"""
"BigDaddy Deserves this so much, after all he had been through he finally did it. Twice."
2022.. and yet. i still watch it. damn
Every Year Pass by i watch this once in a year.
Never gets old
Amazing insight! I dont play Dota and still enjoyed every minute of this video!
Ceb axe call was 🔥
Still the best TI finals. OG shows how trust makes everything possible.
amazing entertainment world class.
"Ceb fucking called it ""This is my game, you're gonna see some shit"""
LGD players are Uncrowned Kings :(
39:15 my favorite part😁
This is the greatest TI of all time
"The difference with Notail and Kuri shows in game 5 pickings.

Notail ask them what they want, and give what they want"
it's a ritual right? coming back from time to time watching this
STILL THE BEST TRUESIGHT!!!! AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! IT'S 2022 NOW AND I STILL CAN'T MOVE ON TO THIS MASTERPIECE!
This always brings me to tears
"Its late at night, and this is probably one of the series that i would watch again and over and over again"
I don't even understand how dota works😂 but i always come here occasionally after my brother showed me the notailxfly drama and this one😂
Rewatching. Rewatching. Rewatching.
which shoulder is it chat? 5:29
ana hiding his tactic in 2:45
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB!!!!
"I get unstoppable continuous goosebumps on game 3 geeeez that round was so good,  I mean I have watched this more than 10 times but the excitement is still there."
TI10?
Give me the T10 True Sight!
"Ahahah at 53:28 Ceb said in french ""Go fuck your mother with your Shaker"""
legends.
Where's ti 10 true sight?
Monay
i love how they went silent after they chanted go home OG. LMAO! HAHAHA ChongChong Choke Team! HAHAHA
"pure, bzm, saberlight crazy BATTLE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Fuw880Ofw"
Rewatching this just because.
Mistake talking about 5 time major winner and now now it became real
"When they said ""ceb ceb is real we won"" that touch my heart so much"
11:30 is that w33 and zai on camera?
Best int final ever
The video where our thoughts on Ceb changed....
Smallson - Topson - Chadson - Godson
"41:48
that's how you lead your team to glory, back then, and until now, even after announced that he will retire he still plays 100 game per week every week, unlike Ana and Jerax they're not as good as before because they didn't practice as much as Ceb does"
Yup 10th time watching
i never get tired watching this...what a game!!....my mind still gets blown away
"28:07 ""You gonna see some shit man""
38:45"
this ana guy so fckn good
I don't feel bad for them fuck me ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeebbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
still the best TI
Watching this for forthtime while waiting for ti10 true sight release lmao
"Waiting for another True Sight with OG, when new roster takes TI 11"
Topson is this guy for real lol
btw does anyone know the track at 37:01?
Ammar (ATF) at 30:52. have you noticed it?
"After OG won in the Stockholm Major i suddenly remember this film. It's so good to watch this film again, i missed this"
I'm just coming back here to have motivation only to lose it again after losing a game.
GG OG CHAMP!
"36:40 Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
38:42"
"Man, I remembered watching this a couple of times when I can't sleep due to stress prepping for a board exam. Their  journey really inspired me last year. ^_^"
i can watch this 100 times and wont get bored of it
Best true sight and best ti fr
8:50
"DO YOU HAVE TRUE SIGHT FOR LAST YEARS TI?

IM WAITING FOR IT"
1:00
"I see more than a just Dota match story here. OG clearly had a winner mindset, and they won. What Ceb did there is a lesson, which you can apply anywhere in life, not just Dota. Don't look back at mistakes until it is over, trust your team and you enjoy process, don't think about reward."
Everytime i feel down and unmotivated i always come back here to feel inspired and movitated feels good man
"58:09 OST pls, ty"
"The first time I was watching True Sight series was this one and I don't know any team that time so I do not know who to root for. I saw ceb being a madlad, calm and his mindset towards  playing is what made me think ""I should root for these guys."""
ZA НАЩИХ
Только спустя 4 года заметил что Аме почти нет в кадре. Видимо чел вообще ничего не говорит во время игр
I don't have much knowledge about DOTA but I keep rewatching this whenever I have a chance
"Ceb is such a great fucking inspiring presence, calming the team down and also hyping them. Love this guy"
"Watching this again makes happy about dota and og but i feel bad for FY, he is a world class player and he deserves the aegis."
35:57 this momment is so bad ass bruh
Still undoubtedly one of the best things to rewatch. Emotions never change no matter how many times I've seen it. Production team should be so proud of themselves for putting together the best True Sight ever.
"dota is a great time sink. Its a place for people to spend time that could be much better spent elsewhere, an investment. For a tiny percentage, its a good investment. For the vast majority, it is not"
great to see a success story. I wonder why there are no videos about the 99% of teams and players that have failed? Oh right. It doesnt make any money
52:52 anime moment
Why do I feel like it's man VS machine.
Where is TI 10 ver :((
Hellow 2022 its tradition to me watching this 1 a month hahaha
OG doto - best doto!

Oh hell yesssss
Notail's sprout kited the shit out of them. So much space
"2022 and still watching on this, the best Championship. i think no more better than TI 3, and than TI8 come with unbelievable Story line. this 5 men is the GOAT at this game and you cant argue about it."
"REMEMBER BOYS, IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER"

Still watching best TRUE SIGHT 🔥
Sub spanish??? hello LATAM??
Ana and somnus twins haha

Lgd introboys
This is a masterpiece. Better than Hollywood movies nowadays
"Lets keep this tradition strong<3
Love from 2022"
39:18 wkwkwkanjing
"I love how OG beat the odds and win back to back, but I honestly feel bad for LGD too"
LGD became background again in ti10
Me in 2022 watching this back.
"Topson : I think i like zeus?? 50:50 though
His team : Orait we're doing zeus guys 100%

What a dream team, ngl."
"Watching this for the 17th time,ill edit if someone reminds me to watch by replying"
"the best TI documentary so far,"
Tradition. Watch true sight so many times
Is there any better motivational video?? Every time I watch i nearly cry. GG
2022 and still watching it again
"the good thing about OG is everyone can decide base on their own perspective.. pure trust, no superior.. pure friendship..."
"Others : This is the chinese Year
Notail: ana is half chinese"
After all these years still giving me goosebumps 🥲
"57:06
shit"
"Kool Kennel Klub forced me to play enjoy, help me guys I'm stuck"
"57:02 - 57:08 ^YEASSss... sh*t.."""
Jerax laughing when Notail and Ceb are cussing out is a vibe
"Jerax:  Ana, you wanna Relo into  the base? 
Ana: No, no, no
Jerax: Memes?
Ana: F*ck Off

Yet, they still relo to destroy that final barracks 🤣"
"When the translation says the hero names I don't hear the Chinese speaking the names, do they have a translations to the hero names also?"
38:47 goosebumps every time
please TI 10 true sight
"Ana still cant his hero till now😆
Miss this team so much❤️"
the moment notail gasp when he knows he will win the TI LOL
Tusk king😂😂….Cebbbbbbb
my boy ame deserves more screen time 😭😭
gfjgeqw[pingwerp]omigwqe
Masterpiece imo
in my bracket support tells me : dude buy your own scentries
"From ""i think zeus"""" to destroying TI9 Topson the legend"
"49:50 they were laughing then Jerax said ""keep it up"""
"game 1 Ana
game 2 Somnus
game 3 Fy
game 4 Ceb
game 5 OG"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZR9mFhBBbE&t=17s   cheack out my gameplay
"Who wins? ""Fake"" French team vs a team with a real French player?"
"14:45
satisfying of kunkaa"
best dota ever.... period.....
12:42 holy cope
"Every time I need motivation
Every time I need something to bring me up
I remember this story
The story of OG"
"Imagine being Topson, no LAN experience and you play Sommnus in Grand Finals getting ganked all the time. I'd shit my pants. The Legend for me"
TI10 true sight modcheck
https://youtu.be/Bv4CqIxqTMA?t=3251 the face when your ego crashes........
Psg lgd are so toxic and that is why they lost
still! PSG LGD deserves to be respect for their game! great grand finals!
The best true sight ever
This is great man I like it.
3 years passed. This shit still chills.
No screentime for Ame. Sadge bro
Still loving it.
who else misses them?
I just realize N0tali gesture after lifting the Aegis is Fly Gesture
that gasp from n0tail: 55:13
i keep repeat watching this until now...the comeback they made.. this is real dota
damn ceb is hella inspiring not becuase of his words but caring about their teammates mentality at all time
2022 still watching the best TI true sight that ever made
18:22 yeah the times when you could take and eat from a friend's hand without being afraid it may kill you
"I love how Ana is like a silent kid, but when the time comes."
"Dude, I love this game so much, man!"
"THE ATTITUDE OF CEB !!!! SO AMAZING, INSPIRING ✅💯 #BestTI"
Shit never gets old
38:41
"And im back here again! 
Always missin this GREATEST TI OF ALL TIME!"
39:03 my favorite one
Ohhhh how i wishh asia server player have a nice teamwork like all of the team in ti have
"- Up to you, Ana! 
- Get top, Get top🔥🔥"
"I dont play DotA but I've watched this 7-8 times 
Watching this makes me feel so good"
1st game we didnt see monkey at all
topson's water never runs out
"the emotions are freaking goose bomish.,  fcuking so incredible. . . . love it"
"I think I am here commenting for like 3rd time
the best ever yet"
Why are both teams going in the same backstage that‘s so toxic.
глеб лучший
"The 4th play they did was the sea server's logic.... Do what you want to do konda unpredictable but suck most of the time ✌️ welcome to hell
-sea server"
"the mid caster be like: treant pos 3? ehhhh... Im not sure how I feel about it (smirking) 7:38
also mid caster be like: why the fuck did I bet on LGD (despair) 9:44"
"55:37 

don't know why, but i know that feeling when you lost even though you gave your all. it hurts to see another dream gets stepped for another person to rise to the top"
who also recognizing they changed some parts of the movie. im sure it was a bit different watchin in 2020 for example. still amazing
I swear ceb is the best coach the way he motivates them in their bad and good time is phenomenal
"now I can say this as a fact, only ceb and n0tail can unleash the beast in Ana."
I'm here again for tradition!
Idc if its becoming a redundant sentence but here goes; I think its a tradition to come back here once in a while to watch the greatest true sight ever (for now) amidst this shitty situation we currently have and obviously we cant wait for TI10 Truesight!! Such a beautiful TI to depict the words “Never give up if you still find your fire burning inside of you”.... Lets keep holding on to our dreams and achieve them everyway possible!! Letsssgoooo!!
Just finished watching this for motivation.
Tradition to watch it once in a while
58:41 thats really BAD ASS
Anna doesn't know who has better late game?
"In order to achieve your dream, you have to destroy other's dream. 


Maaaaaaaan, I love OG but I feel bad for PSG.LGD, they deserve some ti championship too."
Dota please we need ti10 truesight!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Imagine 10years from now, someone ask why Ti8 is the best Ti?"
I like the fact that n0tail smoked in a no smoking area
And this PSG LGD team was to never been seen again as they embarrassed China
38:40
y porque no  sacan un video en   AUDIO LATINO... no subtitulado!
I am just so happy and gracious that this and TI9 were pre covid
Watching this cure my depression 😄
"45:16 I think what Chalice says here is ""If NP is pos 3, then it's useless against TB""."
This is my 7th time watching it since last year
25:17 the one who jinx psg lgd
35:58 the most badass scene in history of dota 2
"Fy' is the best rubick pos 4 i've ever seen. Fy' was the MVP of the finals, what a save playing tusk. Insane time."
"I always come back to this and that Game 4 performance by Ceb inspired me to play Position 3, specifically Axe. Ceb's the best Offlaner in my opinion."
"If Netflix makes a 200 million dollar film about a gaming tournament, it won't be this great, not even a bit close."
CEBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
i like og
31:00 does anyone know what language is that
LGD deserved to lose
"Im back again, a tradition to watch every often."
OG
TI10 true sight asap plssss
Fy god
Ame was missing the whole game🤣🤣
АЗАЗАЗАЗ СПОРТСМЭНЫ
Goosebumps everytime I'm watching this
"Man, Ceb is dicent as a cap. Super supportive environment"
I didnt heard AME talk here HAHa
memories with Tobi
"Law of attraction 
BigdaddyNotail"
still watching and its a best TI ever
Best esport docu no cap
i thought ame was a mute hahahaha he only spoke once I think
Crazy
"Og fan, he’ll yes! A gamer and a dota fan, yes yes! But than ceb’s pma? Man I’m still watching this in 2022!! If only I could have this amount of pma like ceb and yes notail too. This team is and was probably the best one in dota 2 history."
"Whenever i want to quick playing dota, i just come and watch this OG play. By the way  i just a noob from SeaSever."
Can anybody translate what Ceb was saying in French 😂😂
"no judgement, but LGD players need to learn how to chill and smile like OG players. I believe that that smile and chill of Ceb changed the pace of the game"
"they are incredible, love Ceb for being so inspiring they dont care about losing or winning, they are just focusing on the game with som much attention"
Just enjoy the game like og did
sad
Man those calls from Jerax in game 5!!!
this was the superbowl 51 for dota.
someone can write me what say notail and ceb 30:59
54:20
"“We don’t even know what they are picking” that’s the OG, that’s the legendary roaster… Not current players"
He Wasnt kidding when he said it was his game.
Why is TI10 true sight taking so long?
never give up.. thanks to you guys
Never gets old
2022 here!!!!
"I love how in LGDs head OG is after game 1, like the are getting tilted just looking at them hahaha"
go home og its mean go home og and take the aegis
55:36 - 55:42 meme template
"Ceb on 28:56: This is my game, boys.

Present time: That was DEFINITELY his game for life."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOXuV-zJkb0
From topson to Topson to TOPson and now to his final form...TOPdad lmao...in all seriousness tho im happy for them and their daughter is gonna have the greatest group of uncles ever...I hope Jerax stays close with them...
44:06
Still watching 10X year2022
11:00 still so happy gg world peace :D
"We will watch this, in 10/20 years, when dota is dead. And cry"
всем поебаты
36:17 bars
"the nth time im watching this.. 

ana so good he focuses on his illusions instead of main hero and still win"
Imagine messi won 2 champions league and retire 🤷🏻‍♂️ tf !
31:00 hahahaahah ceb and notail speaking native language then jerax just laughing like it was so hilarious HAHAHAHAHAA
GOATS OF T.I FINALS
Damn.... I love Dota
fcking still have goosebumps watching..
55:36 =(
55:36 happy lunar new year guys
The way notail yells “puta”
"My thesis is bringing me down. But seeing how OG kept being positive despite the odds, man I wanna kick some ass with our defence coming soon!"
the story is just incredible
"51:04 even trade ? No it's not, you lose your shit (Morale) . That's why you lose. 
It's about mentality."
watching the whole thing back give me goosebumps dota is a game of euphoria or despair i guess HAHAA
Can LOL give this experience???never
"The difference between the 2 teams is that when OG lose nobody blames anyone instead they try to boost their morale, while PSG.LGD, the coach starts blaming... *I just based this what I watched since it was their only side that is shown, no hate on any teams*"
52:14 dx
Best TI
Some awesome firework scene 55:36
poor ame still cant win
I still get goosebumps watching this and reliving the moment. Still feels like yesterday.
10:15 yeah we're all those guys
Still the best moment in dota competitive scene history. And still watching this January 2022. 😭✨
"Well ana- Pl, ember is so fun to watch, I wonder how he would have felt while playing them in finals and pulling some amazing things out of it"
the always shows chinas teams as bad teams
"If they just listen to Xnova, on rosh. LGD will won this"
watched this for countless of times now. nothing compares to this era of og <3
F.Y GOD against 5 human this is how i saw in TI8  all over and over. 🔥🔥🔥2022
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB!
DOTA IS THE BEST GAME
38:21 ceeb moment
"the notail ending tho.........gave me chills,maybe he did play his best"
Thompson gives a Walter White kind of vibe
"This is so inpiring and well made, every time I watch it it fills me with motivation. The last scene of Notail talking about playing TI finals always gets me."
When they say win or lose it doesn't matter we play I felt that ❤️
55:14
I taught these things only happen in a movie.
34:42 What amazing comeback and the song is so energy
OG will never be the same. This is their best line up ever and probably the greatest team of Dota 2 (considering their major titles and the 2 TIs).
Thanks dota. 💕 God bless you always. Thanks for everything. 🙏
55:13 what a moment
"The team who wins 1st round always lose TI,that didn't aged well"
"eventhough topson in that game two saying he messed up bad, notail and others never blamed anyone and pointed at anyone.. they kept morale sky high.  motivating each, winning or lossing it does not matter.. as long as they enjoy and trust each other.."
asquared
2022 anyone??
Ceb is a God.
Here we go again
Let Ame talk
"To me, JerAx is the best dota player of all time."
Only here to look at Notail adorable cute flower face
Somnus was the strongest player in the game. But OG was the better team. Feelsbadman for him.
I'm a league of legends player but I loved it though I didn't understand anything. Ceb is the goat
2022 год а я все ещё смотрю старые тру сайды. Слезы текут. Хочу чтобы старые ОГ вернулись
waiting for ti10 true sight
Greatest TI ever 🔥👏
I watched this more than Friends. All 10 Seasons. All 7 times. WTF
I wish ti3 finals has truesight
"God, the best"
"Oh, another day of sweatpants"
"the best part is

psg lgd fan say : go home og
og fan say: nothing

this just a game, no need for racism"
vamos ug
Why not ban mag? Xdxd
thats why no one like china player
NOTAIL SMOKING
i like that moment at 44:00
Still waiting for suka blyat
Up until now I think lgd coach always get lot of blame for the lose XD
It's hard to imagine that winning two time TI's is consecutive
"looking in lgd is so painful
they lost final in ti10 again 
Ame is china's best carry but no aegis. its very hard for him I think"
Still watching in 2022
Thre greatest game of dota ever played on earth
watched this so many times still cant find ana's hero
"Lgd can hopefully win TI soon. They have been so strong for so long, just coming up short each time. The deserve it."
"""I dont even what the fuck is going on, I cant even see my hero"" - OG.ANA(PL) HAHAHAHA"
ok
does anyone know the music at 51:57 ???
PLAY AXE = THE BEST GAME!! AXE ♥
ame is reallly a noob player tho' ...PSG lose because of him
2022
The best TI of them all.
when Jerax tells you to man up.. u better do it or lose the game.
best video in youtube.
When all members were the mvp. Tears..
This PSG team could be pundits now. Xnova game reading is something else.
40:20 jerax genuine smile feelsgoodman
My favorite TI
55:37 HAPPY NEW YEAR 2022
win together lose together  slay together slay together slay together
so gooddddd
gives me goosebumps. i watch this one back all the time.. just it doesnt get more intense than this one
Me after losing a match during new year: 55:36
me in New Year: 55:36
"9:18 is the moment i think PSG started to get worried, because they're plans weren't going all perfect like before"
wer ti10????
"4 Majors, 2 back to back TIs with the same roster, and also winning TI8 from the qualifiers. It will take a lot for another team to be able to achieve or outperform the legacy of OG."
Anna he came he saw he played orthodox gameplay he conquered & left !!
True OG fan 25:57
Ceb perfect for captain position he motivated a player.
game 4 still the best
I can't believe I cried because of this video
"I wonder if the approach to the game was what made the difference for the two teams. After every game, noone on OG blamed eachother. they supported and cheered eachother on. After game 4 the couch where scolding the LGD team. Everytime I see that, I think - I wonder if this is the sentence that won OG the Aegis"
Covid chinese
"And the 2 ti's that followed, LGD made the same fucking stupid mistake again when it mattered most."
"N0tail smoking in front of a ""no smoke"" sign is a mood"
"This TS is hard to beat. From friends to enemies, from underdog to champion. From fluke to 2x consecutive TI champion."
I like how the chinese swear words were translated so politely
"NotaiL: ""Some minds are really hard to break tho..."" 
*camera points to fy and maybe* 
Goosebumps! This is the best true sight"
Say again...GO HOME OG...LGD SPORTER SILENT YOU MOUNT NOW...!!!!!
"cool guys doesnt look back to explosions

FY: :(
Sommnus: :("
"really legendary, better than a movie"
this topson looks older than the current one.
Came back here again
5:52 fy makes old school joke but almost nobody gets it
"my now-favorite soundtracks used in this True Sight.

all by alibi music: -

stay hungry stay foolish
mantra"
Me in new year eve 55:38
It has become a tradition to watch this once in a while to remember how wholesome and good dota 2 is
"ahh shit here we go again…

*seriously though i cant stop watching this everytime i see clips of ti8*"
"“If they f***ing start smashing us, we smash back” one of the best lines."
Can't stop watching this
This is better than any movie )
"One of the most inspiring videos I’ve watched ever. They made things look impossible to be possible. Shit happens, but miracle also happens anywhere. I love this team so much!"
Well here i am again. Watching this gold
Im stil watching this
"""Remember boys, its not over till its over""

""Never forgive, Never forget"""
If only lgd listen to xnova lmao.
the best true sight ever
Fy deserve a new teamates
11:33 Zai? Left hand side of the screen for a split second
Already watch this 9 times and still counting
"Жизнь - это TI8, а ты в ней fy 55:36"
"The team dynamics from both sides are overwhelmingly different. OG is able play from behind and win, whereas LGD make mistakes when behind and will just lose. You can tell that OG plays like a sports team and LGD plays like a bunch of dudes getting together and just playing."
"29:17.

Let's all agree that it's called cutting creep waves and not creep skipping."
LGD guy fom 25:19 definitely jinx it bro
feelsbad man LGD played well
Everything is gonna come toegether and it's gonna be beautiful
aT 37:50 THEY LITERALLY WON THE TI
"What will happen IF This is me??

NIGHTMARE  XD"
"Came back to see this again after OG signed a whole new roster, n JerAx is now playing for EG — signaling the end of an era. I honestly in tears. Will never, ever forget about TI8's moments, the best Dota 2 roster I''ve ever seen. Best luck for OG, N0tail, Ceb, Topson, JerAx, and ana."
damn..fucking smart COMEBACK..i just know this cinderalla story....damn awwhhh
The best game. The best TI. The best grand final. The best true sight
Am here after the retire annoucement of BigDaddy
"islamic republic of Iran has killed 5 whole generations and ours was one of them 
Im feeling sad instead of being happy and proud because even if we could get on Ti we cant skip the fucking SARBAZI (just search it) 
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK"
I really love ceb when topson want to play invoker he just give it unlike to other teams xd
Does anybody know what Ceb told at 30:55?
10:16
Always the best❤❤❤
"Des chinois avec des maillots du PSG…
Des chinois qui fument des clopes….
Mais c’est quoi ce truc ???? Pas un sport en tout cas !!!"
55:36 Me on new years.
2:45 ana watching porn + alt tab hahaha he really has fast hands
This is masterpiece. I cant wait for TI10 truesight.
"15.000 hours? haha, omg. My game with the most hours was Everquest 2 with 1500 hours and I think that was sick and never want to play a game so long any more in my life and notail hits 15k? respect."
"perfect edit, great build up of the series, good background info. I will watch all the True Sights in the next games..."
"this one commentator who is talking so fast is so ridiculous. I never follow what he is shouting in the microphone and here he looks so ridiculous. I can imagine, how the asian commentator is feeling to stand there beside him, because of the unsocial behaviour. Ugly."
"Lose together, win together, slay together, slay together, slay together. Ceb is a legend."
"I dont play dota, but omg. This is the best story and finals I have ever seen. OG is literally the biggest inspiration out there in the gaming world. Im crying every time I see them win"
"Rewatched this again today and I must say, I'm still emotional. What a fucking run."
50:44 fav part HAHAHA
11 million views and no ads.
Anyone know what keyboard Ana was using around 2:45 ?
Am I the only one who notice that both team’s pos1 is silent type person😆😆😆
still waiting true sight ti10...
37:28 so funny lol
"JerAx: if they plan to weaver safe lane I pick Nyx now  and it's fucking GG
We can understand how he used to be a comedian"
"This makes me goosebumps,even cried when OG win this ..those epic dota 2 moment you cant never forget ! Those day was the best day of my gaming life ❤️"
lgd is like rtz curse in china😂
Русские есть ?
"06:34 - Holy crap, Ceb is holding a bunch of papers - I lol'd"
Ceb is so positive in every ti i c him play
this shit makes me fucking cry even 3 years after
When a guy with high sense of humor turn into serious 49:52
In game 5 earth shaker is cancer he get all the kills.... Selfish play... Easy game foe og...
I got jebaited by recomendations and thought new True Sight released
ceb: putain merde
WAnna know why there is no shot of ana lifting the aegis? cause he knows he's coming back for it the next year. :3
"55:37 every chinese dota2 player get PTSD , FY with the firework"
19:38 yeah yeah yeahh HAHAHAHah
54:46
"November 12, 2021 
I watched this so many times. damn. I still feel the goosebumps and got a teary eyes as always. This is every Dota 2 players dream like me. Cheers"
31:00 jerax Laughing so hard hahaha
52:22 best buyback ever
14:45 monkaS
"When OG got the mega creeps, you can see the moment where the Chinese fan's souls left their bodies"
I thank God I was able to watch this LIVE.
"Chinese gem on game 3, “executed”. Get literally executed by axe the next game 😄"
This is my game guys
"OG - Seirin
LGD - Rakuzan"
I know it's not your first time here 😆
THE BEST OF THE BEST!
im crying and ive never played dota
"I like how ana's just like ""fuck this i'm going to kill the ancient"" and wins the game."
"Dota is a game of tilt, how to release tilt, how to overcome your tilt, and how ro handle other people's tilts.
-legendary quote"
where is ame? 51:47 fristime i saw him hahah
man after team spirit i dont want to disrespect og but maaaaaaaaaaan this TS run was something else
"Crowd : Go home OG
OG : Sure, with the 11 million dollars"
44:07  For all the kings and slayers
"TI10 is over, but still TI8 is the best !"
You can right a book of quotes for Dota 2 out of game 4.
"Even thouhg our guys wins ti10, OG's ti8 and ti9 like a fairytale. This is on of the best inspiring documentory film of all time."
It is proven that Jerax shot calls were impressive from TI8 and TI9. What a god
"At 52:55 Jerax was holding out the tears, so proud of his team."
TOO LONG
"when you fall and reached the bottom, there is no other way but to go up, but boy OG take it to the top"
Still the best True Sight to this day!!!!
never got bored watching this.... this one pocket reality is better than fiction
There's a power that other team dont have any. OG plays with heart
55-20 WHAT MUSIC????
"omg still watching this thou the best TI comeback ever.

who's still watching this?"
"SO NO ONES GONNA TALK ABOUT ANA ON THIS 5:58 , he was just watching fucking ABC man"
"Game 1 Spectre
Game 2 Kunkka
Game 3 Phoenix
Game 4 Axe
Game 5 Ember"
2:45 what was Ana watching? 😅
"""I can't even see my hero"" most iconic moment"
40:19 perfect example of a moment of pure bliss
That smile from jerax at 40:20 still gets me everytime
"When the fireworks were going off and the cameras were on PSG.LGD, it captured such a sad moment.
They knew the fireworks weren’t for them, and it must been so depressing."
"Oh, Ana, you're so fccing good man"
"Ceb: This is my game bois.

Yep, it truly is your game ceeeebbb."
Without ANA it was not possible
I like how CEB motivates his teammates no one will feel pressure
Why the aura of Somnus is always a villane LOL
OG my favorite Team!
"28:55 This is my game, boys - Ceb
38:48 CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB"
I want to see once LGD in the next True Sight. How hard is this for them and it happened twice.
"I was so happy to watch LGD lose in Ti8, and watching it again in Ti10 is just lovely. Hope to see more of  55:36."
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
"i love this team og so much
I love they let the player choose the hero they want at the last game
I love the speech of ceb 
A team that has a story only from movie"
TI 2018 is the best TI ever in DOTA 2 history!
"40:20
I love when Jerax and Ceb both smiled after they entered the hallway. Like they have poker faces before they got in.
They are overwhelmed because of the hyped crowd.
Ti8 Chills"
Waiting for the TI10 True sight!! Gonna be epic !!!!!!
It's so ironic Chinese used to be Turtle start but now they hate it
"Came back here a few weeks after Team Spirit had a similar Cinderella story. But I doubt their story would top this. The fly/s4 betrayal background, underdogs, one amateur player on the team, from fallen champions back to zero AND then bounced back harder to a hero. Damn this is like a movie."
"Haven't really followed the Dota 2 esports scene, but you can really tell how much a good mentality plays a part here. The Asian team was shit talking, making excuses and blaming everyone but themselves when they lost, while the EU team understood that they were bested and did a quick reset.  Feels like the Asian team was better, but they suffered from that stereotipical gamer mentality, where you don't step up and face hardship, but ignore it and blame it on everything else. One of their dudes even said ""I'm getting a headache from playing"", If i heard that, Id bet everything i have on them losing."
i can't wait to see Yatoro in true sight 😍🐉
"Just rewatched this, and I’m curious what kind of drugs were somnus consuming?"
true sight 2018 & true sight 2019 so lit! 💥
This LGD team was super talented but in  52:59 they already lost. The silence in the boot. I think thats why every team needs a guy like ceb or notail
Ti8 still dabestt
Me sorprende que no hay enfoque a AME que extraño 🙄
"Notail : is the KING who own it
Ceb: is the PRIME MINISTER who make strategy and predict enemy movement
JeRax : is the FIELD MARSHAL who lead the Army and make decision based on enemy movement
Tomson : is the GENERAL in the frontlines 
and
Ana : is a God Of War Himself who descend with his only purpose is to annihilate enemy"
im just watching of anime game  fantasy genre. The plot twist its perfect
severo nivel el de estas partidas ahora voy a retornar a mi triste realidad perdiendo contra bronces y hierros en league of legends
Ceb's mindset and motivation for the group really was amazing here.
I wonder what actually happened if jerax relocated ana for memes.
"27:00, 30:58"
"different reaction for each players in OG team
Ceb : smiling because he success create the team that rebuild from 0 again through the hardest stage
ana & jerax : happy because their confidence is back again after some slump performance
topson : madly happy because he won his first Major tournament of his life,proving everyone wrong. coming just from pub match and left some money to be one of successful rookie in any sports history (i included e sport as the part of sport)
n0tail : madly emotional and happy because he got his revenge after fly left the team and forcing them through the open qualifiers.

sure that everyone deserve it,but if i  choose who really really deserve the aegis . it's n0tail story"
Chidog never win
Ceb mvp for motivation!
Forever in my heart
"Jerax losing his shit after Ceb French flamming LGD had me 💀 
31:00"
OG just played it the way they want and LGD keeps pressured on what they are picking. What a match. Nice OG.
36:30
"Man, I feel so bad for LGD.  Somnus and FY looked so confident before the finals and rightfully so.  They both balled out, but they ran into an unstoppable force on a massive run in OG.  What a series."
24:28 i love how n0tail gives no fck about the no smoking sign lol
"39:16 - Ana: ""I mean, i don't even know what the fucks going on. I can't even see my hero"" 🤣🤣"
I jsut noticed the OG coach never said or done anything.
I don't know how nostalgic is this after 10 years...
i wonder the names of the backgrond musics. especially last one?
Chaina namba uan
This TRUESIGHT vs The upcoming TRUESIGHT of TI10
Sadboi AME 2 time TI 2nd placer.
We need the papers that got them 2 TIs to be on display in Dota Museum
18:23 what were they eating
You know shit's about to go down when Ceb starts speaking in French
59:01 chat wheel detected
Watching it again after ti 10 idk why but this is the only true sight I wanna watch again and again....OG forever
"LHD didn't seem to speak that much with each other. No talk, no win."
"Tat fatty in psg team is the key to losing. He is the only one swearing whole game. As a professional player, this kind of situation isn't allow. He is demotivating and bringing the entire team aura down. Especially his voice, tat kind of tone. Truly a loser tone I would say. Instead, og never blames and they keep their energy rolling, gaining back confidence every minute. Tats wat I call a professional team play!"
Теперь я понимаю что анатан был лучшим и на всегда им останется
Im so happy that Chalice got kicked from the team and irrelevant now.
these true sights are great i love watching them talking in the draft og have all these preparing and discussing time then ceb just goes “give the boy invoker”
jesse laugh when ceb speak french lol
Game 5 of the TI Grandfinals and Topson picks Zeus. Balls of diamond right there. 💎💎
its so fun to see chinese fans cry :D
"Teams that win game 1 lose in the final



Meanwhile team liquid at TI 7....."
Hahaha
I love how jerax says man up
19:41 What a mindmatch Ceb & N0tail!
"did notail said ""Puta"" ? 31:44"
oh damn.. i cant wait to see the next true sight for ti10. PSG ALWAYS 2ND G hahahaha
52:51 Jerax realizing he just won Ti
"Они проиграли потому что не было ""ANA"""
52:01 Jerax shows why he was one of the best...
This is amazing
China will never win TI again because of what they did to WIINGS.
37:28 MEMES 😂
The best true sight will yet to come! TSpirit!
That's why you don't jinx it
"My third time watching this.
This time only plan to watch the intro but I can't stop haha."
why am i here... again
Jesse shouting man up is crazy! Always gives me goosebumps
"TI8 : OG dare pick Axe infront Tusk, OG dont ban ES and yet they win the game ....

TI 10 og fans, ""why you dont ban magnus and WW, is so disrespect, are they du...😠""

🤷‍♂️"
58:55 Time stamp for myself lol
It's traditional to come here once in a while .
i love this fuckin movie so much
38:48 CEEEEEEEEEEEEB!!!
LGD wishing EG poach  notail and jerax instead 😂
I watch this 4 times already
15:48 that robo in the back lol.
Riot is shaking🤣
"Seeing the crowd the hype in each, it is really sad that TI10 miss those aspect. I hope TI11 can be attended by crowd again so something like this can be recreated!"
"You just can't lose with Ceb in your team. The man has relentless positivity just oozing out of him. Hands down, my favourite player tournament."
59:46 feels
"Just started playing, know barely anything, yet this was fucking beautiful man.."
GO HOME LGD NOOB
Im kinda rooting for LGD to win man..After watching ti10 they have felt sadness again and again it's sad
song 35 please
20:12
5:41
46:32 that phrase hits so hard
"I came back watching this True Sight after The International 10. Team Spirit is the greatest underdog after OG, they lose to Invictus in upper bracket, and made their way trough lower bracket, defeating OG, even Secret, who is yet defeated by OG.
I am sure True Sight 10 will be crazy, but True Sight 2018 is still the best.
If you follow OG's role before TI8, and know how they suffer, you'll know what I am speaking.
""The strongest team is the one who have nothing to lose at all."""
It's only my 50th time. See you in two weeks.
salamk
They made LGD an Antagonist
Watching it again after few years. Both teams absolutely incredible
51:45 why do amee so cute here like innocent kid
those emotions from notail.
Amei is going to make a re-appearance for Truesight Ti10. Feels bad man
2:46 u know  what i mean?
"After game 4,,While OG speak about the future.. LGD keep talking about the past.. How they gonna move forward then..."
TI10 LGD also lost like this at game 5. They have the early game LEAD which was massive. And they also have Kunkka. Is this the curse of Kunkka mid for LGD? Damn feel bad for them they are very very very close to winning TI twice.
"IMO, true sight is a great marketing strategy for the game, especially this one. Made me wanna come back and play again."
Ame didn’t say shit for 1 hr lol
China #2
"2018 : Chinese team didnt won Ti
2019 : Chinese team still didnt won Ti
2020 : Chinese released CoronaVirus
2021 : Still didnt won Ti
2022 : 
2023 : 

They win Ti, no new pandemic..easy"
I fucking love this series so much.
OG not winning anymore cos they have no one to tell them to fucking MAN UP!!
No matter how many times I watch this I still get emotional at the end.
"lagi nobar bersama bayu,matew,jepes,salim"
OG keeping up the good mental when losing. other teams losing hope. thats respectable
I like how Johan is casually smoking in a no smoking area.
"no matter how many times I watch it, it still gives me the biggest goosebumps"
anyone recognise that AME face was not even single focused on this TRUE SIGHT
Best true sight EVER!!!!
If PSG LGD banned Magnus like they banned Spectre they could have won TI10
"I cant believe that the first 3 games is covered in a quarter of the length of the video, to make room for one of the best comebacks in TI history"
"Fucking shit dont jinx us 

U just fkin did"
waiting for true sights TI 10 Team Spirit
27:00 look at lgd just predicting every hero og will pick
We come back for more ✌️
48:52 rly china bet :D
"in game 5, any logic behind banning drow?"
"That TI was the best of all the TIs. Frankly speaking OG played around jerax's plays even at the later stages of game while lgd only played around Fy's plays only during the start of the games. Lgd should have backed Fy's plays like og did with Jerax's, they might have won. These pos 4's were on a different level altogether, jerax won though with the help of his team that time"
"Dota has best esports scene, no other game can even compete, because the game is so complex and to reach as number 1 best team in world is so difficult."
55:36 happy new year
even Notail still have a doubt in TI9 final
"Watching this almost 4x now, I'm OG fan, winning drives you crazy but watching the emotions of LGD after the loss is so damn sad😔"
I think this is the curse of Wings Gaming against LGD. They also lost TI10 to Team Spirit.
This roster is legendary. It will be hard to surpass them as they won back to back TI.
Ceb is the true leader
"To this date, the amount of people who hate on OG and call shit trash tier, simply surprise me. Like there are people who say their wins were a fluke, they're trash so they're not winning anything. I mean is this a joke or what? Dendi has been to 3 finals and won only one. It was his dream to win 2 back to back ti because he himself said it would be incredible to do so as it's hard enough to win once, let alone win twice in a row. Also, Liquid has been to 2 finals and won only one. LGD has been to two finals and won none. These alone should tell you how hard it is to win one ti let alone two. OG has literally been to 2 finals only and won both, back to back. Anyone who undermines this team's talent has to be ignorant af. Not only that, OG won valve's very first Major and kept winning for 4 times - if the ti achievements weren't enough. Notail alone has 6 major titles under his belt. But sure it was also just a fluke."
Скоро спирит тут будет
"Everytime I watch this, it makes me cry at the end. This is the most awesome Dota team ever., so much mental strongness! OG 4 Life <3"
"LGD 2021: Here we go again, the pain"
almost forgot to watch this this week
LEGENDARY
"Every now and then ,we come back to watch this to remember nothing is impossible and nothing else would matter if you play your best....every year i will be watching this ....best moment in dota history"
Jerax @31:05. lmfaooo
Notail might be the captain bt ceb mentality really carry the whole team atmosphere.
STILL THE BEST TI WIN FOR ME!!!
Notail takes a deep breath 55:13
"I still get chills from somnus saying ""kunkkaaaa"" 😬"
I came from LOL. They don't make document like this anymore. That's why I left. It's so terrible.
This is the 70th time i watched this vid. And still got goosebumps whenever ceb says 'ill fuck him'giving somuch confidence to his team.
"the chinese are really arrogant, also laughing and calling ceb ass for looking at his notes.,love seeing the chinese teams lose,."
"3rd game draft phase

OG : **drafting**
LGD :**narrating**"
there are two moment that related to buyback in this TI 😂
Og are more together Lgd on the other hand is full of ego
Best TI
"Notail: Smoking
Ceb: Monke"
"No matter who you were going for, watching how up themselves PSG were immediately turned you off them. OG were just about friends and fun and it showed."
52:14 Is that a girl with underarm hair?
LGD 2x TI Choke
"31:08 Screaming in your own language, Ceb really gap the Spirit"
Need this copium because of the TI10 result.
"Still the best true sight for me, but the upcoming true sight would have the best story from underdogs, first timer, to champion in 1 time"
9:44 Merlin faces here be like indifferences lol
One of the best moment in my life.
Who is here to see again after the TI10?
"LGD lacked humanity. Look at them. Simple robots, no communication, no reciprocity, no teamwork. The OG is opposite. Everytime match ends they do isnpirational speech and support each other. The reciprocal support is very important"
the best and always the best true sight!
"Team Spirit's run is epic in itself, but the storyline of 2018 OG still cannot be topped."
Best True sight ♥️
"Жду TRUE SIGHT TI 10 
Наши парни повторили чудо против ЛГД"
They are being so nice with the English translation of what Ceb is saying in French... LOL
"Jerax was the magic i think, his shot calling is what won them 2 TIs. Something we didn't see in TI 10."
where ame ?
[Go Home OG] *LOL* one of reason why LGD lost
"Este video es la gran inspiración cuando pierdo bastantes partidas y me anima a seguir intentando ganar, extraño ese OG de antes."
"2 time chokeking get fuck so hard 
like no more tear to cry"
"Im gonna leave this comment here. so after a month or a year, when someone likes it, i get reminded of this incredible history of True sight"
Notail built OG as a family.
59:01 chat wheel
"this is the most dramatic TI grand final ever, OG comeback stronger"
"One of the best. ❤️ 

Even though we lost ti10 
You guys are still the winner OG.
People's champion."
"Ceb, source of power"
It is a tradition now to go back to this after a while.
I like this movie. Almost like karate kid(jaden smith version)
"Я из 2021,закончился т10,лжд все также пикают кунку и все так же отлетают от Магнуса и Эмбера )))"
56:31 Humble God giving respects to every single one on PSG.LGD team.
38:39
"Adik adik fans oji
Silakan buka buku sejarah Bab 8 ya
Jangan lupa absen dulu"
"The narrative surrounding OG and TI finals were absolutely phenomenal.Not only was it organic,but it also contained all the elements that a great story requires.This is the primary reason as to why this piece of entertainment will be amongst the very best ever to be produced."
i got a headache probably because of stress. Watched this and i'm cured. 🙂
True sight marathon after TI10 ends.
China sucks🤣
2:47 did ana just at+tab lol
Feel bad for Ame. Come back stronger at Ti11 bruh
best true sight ever
Toronto at 7:30
is TI10 true sight will get 12M in 1 month ? let see
"Coming after Ti10, what ever it is, OG is the greatest team."
"12:41 “ Team that won game 1 always lost the final “ 

TI8,TI10: are u sure about that?"
OG!!!!
"""some minds are hard to beat though"" *showing fy and somnus, oh literal chills"
Who is the caster?
Collaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaapse
Bye xinq fy will be back
Eagis is❤️💝
Best ti final ever
the best ti ever.
Looking at Ame after another lose at ti10 :c
"Every time i watch this, it gives me goosebumps. It makes me want to make a team and wanted to play TI xD. The best true sight so far for me. I wonder what ti10 true sight would be like. Can't wait."
TEAAAAAMMMMM SPIIIIRIIIIIIIT
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
"This is best True Sight so far . OG 2018-19 mb the best team we have ever seen 
but Team Spirit 2021 TI run is most amazing journey and growth throughout the tournament
from 0-4 start to beating Fnatic, OG, VP, IG, Secret and boss fight vs LGD
Collapse Magnus, 3 rampages from 18 yo Yatoro, 14 carry hero pool, EZ GAME"
"lgd during drafting: thinks with a clear head
meanwhile og: i dunno, fuck it, ti finals man let's go"
I FUCKING LOVE OG
Как долго после инта True Sight делается?
if you pause between 55:13 to 55:14 you could see Notail's expression. An expression that we all know so well at some point in our entire life--- bliss.
Istg i  havent heard Ame say a single word this whole true sight
30:58 can someone spell this in french or whatever language just ceb used.
LGD at TI10: 55:36
i came here again after saw a TI 10 watched LGD get rekt for the second time on the final with the same score
"Being cocky is LGD problem, it costs them 2 TI"
And again Ember Spirit ended their dreams to become TI champion last night.
37:31
"i like these lgd more than current lgd, they fear of ana spectre and ban it meanwhile current lgd just won't ban collapse magnus ffs"
"TI 8
""We still have RP guys, dont worry""

TI 10
""We still have Horn Tusk guys, dont worry"""
55:36
ANYONE COMEBACK SEE THIS ON TI 10?🤘
"Sorry guys but that echo slam by jerax in the 1st game during rosh, that mentality is what saksa dont have, thats why OG didnt win ti10.. just real talk sorry if anyone will be offended with this comment."
Dont know what will happen in True Sight TI 10. But this is still the best for me.
It’s sad how Ame loses a Ti again :(
waiting for next True Sight
It must be a little awkward when both teams pass each other in the hallways after each game!
This is still the best TI ever…
55:37 😐
N0tail deserves it ... 👏  and still deserves 3rd win )
"why im crying watching this :, better drama than kdrama"
EU>China>SEA>SA>NA remember that
"PL is 25 guys [sinister music]
is the icing on top"
"they should form new team name ""Never choke again""
pos1  Ame

They might lost their old roster and drive for this TI 10 but THIS truesight surely cemented OG as legends...win or lose still supporting them
WHO IS HERE AFTER TEAM SPIRIT WON TI 10👋
rewatching while waiting for ti10 true sight
it's sad to see Ame lose again
stay strong psg.lgd
Watching after ti 10
Still the best truesight
Can't see Ame here.
time to rewatch again XDDDDDDDDDD
44:06 Ceb's Motto as Chat Wheel 😉
"PSG LGD: 2 times TI runner up
OG: 2 times TI champion"
this was really like a fucking anime or a inspirational movie where the main theme is friendship and not giving up lol you can see the difference in how kinda toxic LGD was everytime they lose they're like the antagonists who will never win because of their negativity in the game plus that ending where OG just yolo picked the heroes they're most comfortable with
Watching this 3 years after. Poor LGD. Curse is real
It's heartbreaking to see Ame lose two game 5s of TI grand finals twice :(((
Team spirit have their moment now 👏🏻💯
ANAAA
Their strat is to enjoy the hero what you wanna play. Wtf
anyone else here after ti10 psg lgd game 5 lose 2 years now
Waiting for Ti10 True Sight!
Your here because Team Spirit won TI10
КТО ПОСЛЕ ПОБЕДЫ TEAM SPIRIT? 😍

Lol. Spirit won TI 2021
4 matc was tthe best matc ever of dota
Rewatched this after Team Spirit Won! The Feels!
TI10 OG LOSE
"Who's here after Team Spirit's epic victory?

"Best true sight ever. 
Now in TI10 it's going to be PSG.LGD vs Team Spirit and who ever wins this tournament, TI8 will still be my fave truesight!"
I'm reviewing this before the Spirit - LGD final
All that arrogance from @teamsecret but Secret still has no aegis. At least @OGesports has 2.
Team Spirit wins ti 10  For sure my favorite Team  I Love TSpirit
I fell this is a the best TI ever
36:00  min  PL of Ana... Damn
You can see the difference between the Dota2 tournas and League Of Legends' tournas
"Watching this on the last day of TI10 always bringing back the old days for OG, roothing for PSG.LGD to win TI10 this year"
"""Block the User"" lmao"
"Notail is the captain, but Ceb is the leader. I don't even like him as a person or player but holy hell what a natural born leader, Napoleon could have taken a note or two...every comment perfectly placed to motivate, relax or uplift at exactly the right time. Also after I watch this LGD are a lot more likeable, they are much more chill than I thought."
Man this will be the best ti ever and the best true sight
chinese men + long nails = love. Horrible anyway
"And one by one they're retiring, It's fun while it lasted."
Ahh good old times
OH MAN!!! I MISS THE THE INTERNATIONALS WITH THE CROWD!!!
Oh god how much i wished they would win this ti as well. Goodbye OG
That intro will always remain iconic. now that OG is out of the tournament I'm excited how ti10's True sight will pan out.
OG DIDN'T EVEN FACE PSGLDG THIS T.I  :/
psg KANGKONG
"""Ceb,Ceb
Come on
Its real""
I felt that...


Also their expressions after winning is just priceless
Notail : slams table and screams
Jerex : yeaaa 
Ana : comforts ceb 
Ceb : couldnt believe this is real 
And of course
Topson : whooooooooooo yeaaaaa fcuk yea first time TI,Wins TI"
STILL! the best TI 🔥
Who's here after ez game SoBayed ?
"Lose together, Still with you OG no matter what. 🌻 I'll always be your fan, You guys taught me a lot of things & I broke down yesterday after the defeat and knowing its Ceb's last tournament. Until next time, Lets slay together next TI. Dream OG🌻"
"""Don't jinx it"""
Fans back here after og lost ti10
Came back here to remember
Sadge
"Win or lose, OG will always be the GOAT"
Watching this true sight again after OG got knock out in TI10 😢
Who came back here after watching Dota archives ana buyback
Who's here after their defeat against TS?
6:32 and this is where LGD's downfall begin.
From this we can see the impact from jerax. This is what OG miss on TI 10
wanna relo into their base? Memes?
imagine if ceb didn't become a player
Watching LGD be sooo smug and getting absolutely wrecked. Hope this keeps them up at night.
I really think that if they used global silence to help Ame things would be different in that bottom clash at game 5.
"""Oh my Fck"" - still legit"
Setelah OG pulang di TI10
Who's here after OG lose at ti10 ?
Compared to the others Xnova and ame are very silent lol
55:18 vs 55:37
Missing jerax and ana🥺

Watching this again after they lost in TI10.

"who's here after OG got eliminated in TI 10, oh man missed the old days Ana + Jerax combination"
OG fandogs watching this once again since they just got skewered back to airport LMAO
I just came back here after OG was eliminated by Team Spirit this TI10 just reminiscing the good old days by peak OG.
Watching this after they eliminated in Ti10 😢
"Yup, you're here because OG got eliminated."
OG fans now crying and back to watching true sight 😂😂
No team won TI back to back and no one will except OG
Even TI10 true sight in the future this is still the best
Who's here after OG lose to Team Spirit?
Me after OG lost at TI10: Here we go again 🤍
Who here after they lost to Team spirit?
"Everyone come back here quickly. Right now. It hurts. But they won't be the champion all the time. They have nothing to prove anymore to anyone. They already did it. But to say it directly, it hurts and a bit disappointing. Their draft seems off really. Not even a respect ban on that Magnus."
Ez Game - TorontoTokyo
Who's here after OG's loss to Team Spirit?
Coming back after OG eliminated from ti 10
Watching after og  got eliminated 😢
"OG just got eliminated and i'm here reminiscing, dont mind me 🥲"
"Back here after OG lose to Team spirit. xD . 3peat my ass

Ez game . Haha. Lmao"
Just in. OG has lost to TS so I’m going back here just to enjoy our old times shshshhshshs
who's here after TI10
Only we can do now is reminisce this moment. Bye TI10 OG truesight.
28:52   Never forget
LA violence de CEB
Waiting for the 3peat true sight…
"Ive watch this a hundred times , Still gives me goosebumps everytime ."
Imagine you're the person at their back watching them.
There's something about this TI that's so FUCKING MAGICAL!!!
"Casters say Topson was ""Nothing before this,"" then fast forward two TI wins later..."
CEB is the glue of this team
Come back here after 2 month.
The best oG and Ana 😭😭😭
"Go Home OG
looks like they did

with the aegis"
"Es increíble este true sight, lo he visto varias veces :C"
"55:36 staff :oh shesh, what should i do? haha"
Jerax laughs so hard when Ceb is cursing in french hahahaha
Ceeeeeeeebbb
Still gold!
#letanaandjeraxplay
"35:50 pl lvl 25 guys
37:28 relo back to the base memes
38:37 ceb call"
The ending gives me goosebumps 59:45
who's here after secret beat the crap out of OG
sup og fans
"Ceb: they dont know what to pick.
Also Somnus: Im getting into my death gaze mode."
My favourite true sight still. Watching LGD act so arrogantly only to get fucked on in the end and their faces reflect that is copium as hell.
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB! 38:45
"Obviously, OG's story is incredible, but PSG-LGD played amazing, and they came across so likeable. If OG doesn't win TI10, those players deserve a win."
the shoutcaster sound so virgin what a cringe voice beta male
watch to get hyped for ti every season
jerax is a god
"CN best copy king... laugh at ceb for bringing notes to draft at ti8, lost the game, wake up and think why they lost could be without bringing notes to game. 大意啦，then brought notes at ti9 still lost can’t even go face OG at TI9. So what they did was recruiting whole team to analyze OG nigma EG secrets plays in covid year 20. It is all planned"
"The difference b/w both of them is the ""Leader"". This is just not only a game. This's also about life, the lesson we've learned from their story, their leader, and all team members.
Thanks for the most epic, emotional TI true sight ever."
"Бл*ть, какой же Ceb оху*нный!"
"My boyfriend brought me to D2 back then in 2019 when he played D2 back and at that time I did have no knowledge about it. He did show me all the true sight videos and I have least interest in it. Now when TI10 happens, I'm re-watching these true sight videos back. I just want to thank him that he did show me another universe which is so colorful. Really addicted D2 !"
中国玩家心中永远的痛
Fy 2021: not again
You can see that CEB has is 100% support on his teammates on whatever they want to use :D
Ame doesnt speak a word in the whole video?
Not being racist but I'm 99% sure those who dislike this video are all Chinese peeps lol
I keep coming back here cos its Dota season
tnx to fly xD
The 1-day hiatus before ti10 main event lets me rewatch this. Here's to OG vs LGD in grand finals again in ti10!
The best true sight no cap.
Dream's come true.
"I've watched this countless times and still so good, also, the sound design/engineering on this video is the best I've ever seen"
psg lgd talk about the game while ceb talks about life... and thats beautiful
43:56
"Come here again after OG win TI 10
Three in a row"
Literal Chills Everytime you rewatch this Truesight.The two teams had literally two different atmosphere .. This truesight told it all. Good Luck to OG at Ti 10.
best TI there will ever be. I really miss this OG line up
"The greatest TI run of all time
18th (last place) most likely to win ti that season
Ana mid player turn carry in one year
Topson first lan
Ceb coach to a player in one year
Notail from carry to support in one year"
"these chinese players are so arrogant at first, and look at their face at last so fun😂"
52:01 best communication ever
Topson: *grabs ana* we won TI. WTF!
The story of OG in 2018 is just perfect. It's like a movie. Classic.
"No haters could even talk, cause LGD had all their main heroes in the tournament drafted for them."
fy :(
Yo why cant we have this for league. Amazing video btw.
55:37 is still the best part
"OG IS THE GREATEST DOTA 
 
OG THE GREAT   OG WILL WIN   TI 10"
He is the Face of Dota 2
that feeling you're about to win only to get crushed in the later stages of the game over and over again has to be too fucking painful
"I've watched this more than 8 times. it's a very emotional, heartfelt struggle. congrats og, you deserve it"
Guess it's a go home LGD
Never gets old.
"Jerax calls are all on point. When he talks, everyone quickly listen. His understanding to this game is unbelievable. What a chad."
"Ana's ""one last ride Johan"" gives me the chills everytime man, what a legend he is."
im still watching now 2021.10.5
Ti10 here we go!!! Hope we can watch free live on this channel ❤ Go OG!!!
I watch this every night
3 days...
44:06 for chatweel
Did you also come to watch before ti10?
can someone translate me the french curse words of ceb
one of my favorite videos on youtube and i dont even play dota
3:48 notail slightly smiling and recognizing their presence just shows how much respect he has for the lgd and dota
52:53 OG scream so loud like a monster. mean while Ana: Meow
"The high on this is so high
And the low of this game is  so low...."
October 2021 and I still watching this good movie
"39:49 dude I love this game so much man 
44:09 loose together win together slay together slay together slay together"
30:58 ceb talks some french hahahaha look jerax laughing he cries
watching this after Ceb’/s surgery
"49:49 ""Johan Prophet anybody?"" LOL
They still cracking jokes even in the edge of loosing. What a legend.
Truly to their ""let's have some fun."""
"The LGD team like a toxic bunch of guys, while OG always have this family positive vibes"
The LGD's captain drafting actually the culprit of the losses
LGD was a powerhouse. They were obviously gonna win it but all stars aligned for OG every fucking time 😂 almost like a cheat code stars aligning in their favor
Can we just all appreciate PSG.LGD? without them this TI8 will never be exciting as it is.
its a tradition to watch this every year before Ti starts.
OG is the best team ever to play DOTA 2. They always play with their heart. I just hope they can still defend their title with Sumail on their roster.
"Dota beginners: watching Dota tutorials
Me: Ti8 truesight"
"stay strong boys
best captain"
"That good to see jerax and ceb push their team to fight rosh on game 5, when their team loss lot confident on early game. That crucial call. Og turn around this game after rosh fight."
"the game 5 set up start from notail, he already build the foundation of the game on his mind start with NP + rubick. that's how the leader intuition. even experienced player like jesse not even think twice just full with trust.."
The crowd should say go home lgd lol
lgd is to cocky
"can't move on from this true sight

🌻🌻🌻"
Notail forgot his shoes. HAHAHA
30:32 I love how Ceb so calm being cornered and then reverse kill them like nothing happened
The most biased crowds yet OG slaps their mother fkcing face
"""some minds are really hard to break tho"" *camera zoom in to Fy and Maybe*"
welp I'm back
you guys are legend!!!!
55:37 yo buscando partida en año nuevo
"Good god, haha the only time FY opens his mouth, they get crushed. 😂😂😂"
"9:20 my fave echo slam, and his face lol."
Man to be honest CEB gives a great fuckin speech. he motivates and brings energy to the team
I've never played watched or played a game of Dota 2 in my life.. but I just binge watched this and the 2019 final. Absolutely excellent! I'm not sure I'll ever try this game but I'll definitely be watching the tournaments in the future.
55:37 tulala c gago eh hahaha! 😂
"my 9th time watching
😆😆"
A fluke a really amazing beautiful  great fluke of the century
"Still satisfying to watch that OG wins TI8 againts LGD. 

The true obstacle is when you underestimate your foe."
"I swear JerAx is a whole vibe here, so chill"
"Even as a Rubick, Jerax's Fissures are impecable"
"2 weeks to TI 10, time to get myself hyped up again"
"Looking at it right now, it is so silly that any team were favorites against OG. These guys are the greatest team in esports history. They had a god at every position"
"what makes OG win is they play without preasure at all ceb n notail are just chilling and making other feels so free to play,thats amazing to watch"
I feel like I'm watching a movie man though i don't know even dota basics
ti 10 coming soon
ceb come on it’s real
AME is a silent killer
LGD is full of arrogant 🥴
Chalice's Brewmaster is perfect
"Iam not even play dota, but i watching this with full emotion.."
"TI in few more days and im watching this, hope TI10 will be better than this as we waited for long !"
"The silly sense systemically strap because page conventionally back after a parched seashore. cut, humdrum fire"
OG is like the Man United of Dota lmao
"Moral lesson, dont be too cocky."
9.19 somnus reaction is everything 😂
LOL CHINESES
52:51 THIS IS OG
"Am i the only one compare the length of the video? It is almost two times length longer from the previous TI7 ? Damn..

And the detail is fantastic on this TI."
AXE LIKES THIS VERY MUCH!
"I think it's great to see how OG back each other up emotionally and that they truly deserve the Aegis. This is a really inspiring video showcasing the power of strong mental and bonding in a team that will carry them really far. Gotta give big props to the video editors and the commentators that make the videos way more enjoyable!

I also don't want this True Sight to give the impression that LGD or Chinese teams don't know how to cheer each other up or that they only point fingers at each other. There are very little moments in this clip that include the LGD conversation with each other in their supportive moments. They won't be there in the final if they are not trusting/helping of each other. There are many things we branded badly to Chinese players/fans which I think is unwarranted. The only thing that I really wish they do more is giving the opponent a deserving cheer/applause. Aside from that bit, they are just as passionate, supportive as many other teams around the world."
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"ive watched this like 10 times maybe now, and its incredible how instrumental jerax was to their win. his calls were always on point when he spoke up and made them. game winning shit. best ti ever"
"Still incredible and so inspiring, everytime I watch it"
52:00 this Rosh played by OG changed the shape of the game and my boi jerax read the map so frickin well
"55:38 The irony of life. When there are victors, there are also losers, and that is fine."
Notail reaction at 55:12 is all the heartbreak and despair he had to endure that all flashed back in one second
"This is my game boys.

- Ceeeeeeeeb!!!"
I still feel the pressure as if it's a live show.
@31:00 my favourite moment
"I always come back to this 2018, and 2019 back to back so many times! It is still that GOOOOOOOODDD!!"
Ml player here.
Wear your jacket lgd… because you lose
I honestly thought og would call gg so early this game. Fcuking impressive how they kept up and won
"Lol chalice was overconfident 😂 the guts to call ceb ""shit"" and look what happened to them"
"Ceb knew before it happened. OG didn't care, PSG LGD  thought they win already..."
"I watching this, watch again, and again.
And i know they give opinion and respect other choise."
It was way better than any movie to watch.
Why do Chinese players always feel like anime antoganists?
Here for my monthly rewatch of this TI 👀
"Topson when drafting
TI8: I dont know.
TI9: Pick me pugna."
"I love how the LGD fans look when game 5 was about to end.
Odly Satisfying 🤣"
casting is just 100% changes the ambience of the match.
"It was as if Jerax revealed/unleashed his Haki at game 5. He rallied them into those crucial moments, which ultimately to their victory.
 
His reaction at 52:50 though. He could barely contain his emotions"
"52:00
I wanna fight
Yes yes
Yeah Can we do it?
No echo slam, no global. Guys they're dead
Man up guys
I mean the shaker's up
No echo He does nothing MAN UP
Go rosh go rosh 
Let's go let's go
FUCKING MAN UP
Yes
Guys win or lose we don't care we play

This comms right here is what really sends shivers deep down to my bones"
"When ceb says ""ill destroy them"" and he fuckn do it damn it give me chills"
I guess the power of friendship does exist
Just rewatched it a month ago... And now rewatching it again.
胜利在握，打什么龙，无言
fy still support god!
55:35 really appreciate the editing here. Makes me feel immersed. Really feeling the sorrow there. Damn.
Less than a month for T10 who's here for the hype???
Man CEB is so great
"""The team that win 1st game always lose the final""

Fy 2018"
"Chinese FANS: Go home OG!
 hahahaha And now who's laughing? 
OG FANS: Chinese people not deserving to win this game hehe"
9:43 Synd at his finest
"Re watching the trilogy curse lmaooo 
From redbull ti8 HAHAHAH"
"4:31 n0tail beeping... ""microphone""... ""you wont fool me, i know you´re da bomb"""
Better than movies nowadays..😅
what background song they use at 54:32
30:59 уроки французского от себа
Ana seem to be happier than Ti9 ( sr about my bad English)
This Truesight is nostalgic. Fy ate his own shit after this epic comeback from OG.
LGD is unprepared for Topson. They are surprised and shocked.
I HECKIN LOVE OG BatChest
Miss ana
from go home og to og og og
the advantage of team OG is they trust each other .
Damn! I’m here watching this again 😂🤘🏼
"AH sh** , i cry dunno why! I've watched this always many times! Best by both of them! I feel sad for chinese team, but its okay cause they did great! OG just was so good! Cheers!"
"ceb: this is my game boys

chat wheel after ti8: ""Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeb!""

what a God"
"LGD: ""Teams that win game 1 always lose the finals.""

OG: 👀"
i dont even know how many times I've rewatched this
imagine even just coming in 2nd place you still became millionaires sheesh.
"I like what they did when JerAx went ""They have a really big problem, PL 25 guys""
Its like you are entering the final part of a game where the final boss awaits"
59:00 the OG chat wheels
The Best Truesight.
I cried again guys idk why........
Attitude ka gurl
OG picking hero like why not let's just play and enjoy! not so much pressure hahahaha.
you know OG gonna win this when you see jerax laughing while playing. 31:05
At 57:05 I think the cameraman said shhhhiiiittt.. Lol
38:25
Watching for the nth time at 4am for my daily motivation
Best true sight . Best games of 5
Watching this in 2021 lmfao when hearing OG didn't even had a chance and making fun of there's roster... 2021 OG is still the greatest team...
Go home OG? Nyahahha these fans lmao 🤣
watched this 3 time already. I will always love / hate dota 2
this remains my favorate true sight
"i can watch this over and over again, what a brilliant work"
Anyone know what is the meaning of notail said at 31:44?
this is gonna age like fine wine
lgd就是cjb，吹了那么多年拿了什么ti啊？
55:36 man this is a good gif meme. LMAO
"Started getting back into Dota 2 after stopping many years ago during the Dota 1 era. Stumbled across this and boy did it make me cry lol. Competed in many local lans back in the day and the feeling of winning is euphoric, let alone winning the almighty TI. Inspiring to see where the game has lead up to today💯"
Noob psg that's what you get too much confidence lol dumbass
Jerax is so chill throughout all the games.. If I may say so personally as I used to play on an amateur team.. Having a guy like that on the team really helps the team build this resistance to pressure and makes the game more enjoyable.
spectre is so badass ! well that was the dota god at his prime years brudah ahha
"Ceb drafting Axe: ""you gonna see some shit bro""


Everyone: ""well, shit"""
"ti8 ana after winning: celebrates like a normal human being
ti9 ana after winning: meh"
I don't know why but I can feel johan at 100%
"damn, topson really grow :"") from nerdson to chadson"
Make me goosebump after 3 years..
"Ti8 OG the immovable object
Ti9 OG the unstoppable force."
"Crowd: GO HOME OG!
Also crowd when OG is winning: AAAAAAAAAAH"
I'm not even playing dota. But Im so thrilled all throught out. This is so epic!
I think psg.lgd thinks too highly of themselves
I watch this 6 times the best ti ever ❤️
The Greatest Comeback Story Ever. Ever.
This needs a anime version.
Rewatching this. Can’t wait seeing OG Gameplay again!
im not a fan of og but lgd feels like the villian here. makes them even more badass even tho they lose
GO HOME OG!!!! With Aegis of course 🤣🤣🤣
"""Holy crap, ceb is Holding a bunch of papers"" 6:31"
Topson is 2/2 in TI..
Again watch it and get happy cry
8.00 the fuck dude his armpit have hair
"Поставьте лайк, чтобы иностранцы думали что я написал что-то умное🤔"
"""What if they call GG and we miss it?""
--The biggest mystery LGD had to solve on the final."
It was amazing for Ana and Topias to experience this.. To sit side by side with people who have strived there whole lives for 1 thing and after years and years of failure to see that hard work pays off. Congrats again OG for giving us the best year of dota ever hands down
Ceb called to back at rosh pit. My boy Jerax told them to fucking man up coz LGD used all their skills. One of the reasons I think Jerax deserves more respect. The little details that he does. Even cracking jokes under pressure. It really helps a lot.
OD pixel greatest caster all time
buhdha is too weak
The confidence they have in round 3 was overwhelming and I always end up watching this when I'm bored.
"And what difference does it make fy you or somnus if you didn't take aegis, Og are the best of the best"
Not having this team this upcoming TI hits different.
i like this
24:13 N0tail shitting his pants.
"Sometimes, all you need to hear in your hard moments is a ""Man Up!"""
30:38 Lakad Matatag! RIP Dunoo!
"Ceb,”you’re gonna see man... you’re gonna see some shit”
Ceb in the game: CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBBBBBBB"
"The ajar probation especially nod because multimedia internally fire modulo a deafening zephyr. versed, alike quit"
Ame was so innocent but brutal in game
RIP kuya dunoo LAKAD MATATAG
Topson wasn't really that confident during this time.
"OG 100% deserve the win. 
Good attitude, good mind set, non toxic."
9:24 #LakadMatatag
Mad respect for TI and OG 🤍 what a combo 🤍 love them forever
"The pressure of this TI man, reaching game 5 proves that both team already deserves to win, but too sad its a tournament."
4:30 soundtrack please? :<
"""GO HOME OG""
OG : well, now dota is my home"
Almost forgot to watch it today
"28:17 ""what do they think they are""
""Only two consecutive wins TI winner"""
It's really satisfying to see the overconfidence dying in those eyes.
"Kuya D/ Boss Dunoo Sobrang laki ng part mo sa Dota community I wish Buy Back is a real thing, TI without you is never be the same Rest In Peace Sir Chief!  “Lakad Matatag!"" I'm always looking up to you from the very first i learn Dota you show me on how Filipinos are made of. Love you Kuya D."
Ceb is like the Captain America of this team the way he motivated OG was pivotal to their success. Notail is the heart of the team. Jerax is a fuckin genius. Topson is unpredictable and Ana... well he is Ana.
Don’t know how many time i had watched this 🤣
Topson screaming the hell out at 55:22 is such sa freakin mood I love the energy!.
"RIP to a legend, Kuya D! DOTA will never be the same again. Here are some of Kuya D's famous lines embedded in DOTA history

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG0lTeVwiu4"
best cast ceeeb
"Ceb is such a good motivator, man. He's a fucking legend!"
I hope that ice frog change the muting of players. Trash talking is part of the game.
Man if i walk passed my enemy like that i would throw a jab
moh isin
Tusk king HAHAHAHAH
Dota so rich that valve can put a 1hour video without ads.
"crowd chanting ""go home OG"" only fueled them to play even better lmao"
55:12 n0tail feeling it
55:13 what happend
"40:01 , notail juked ana :D"
"When i want to be motivated through games, i always watch og ti8 and ti9. And i can watch them forever. Winners mi dset is always different."
"I have watched it so many times 
And still it gives me goosebumps"
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB
ah yes it is a must to come back once in a while.
56:33 ana is a good guy through and through
Watched it for the 8th time this week T_T
38:41
Ceb is very charismatic! Wow
54:45 Lol
"So I come here to this video because it’s therapeutic to me, calms me down and gives me hope. 

So OG qualified for ti10 in these very same situation, even though we don’t have ana and jerax but they’re place has been taken by other OG family members sumail and saska! 

Would be nice to have another one of the legendary therapeutic video. 

I hope I can come back this to comment with a smile and a tear in my eye. Best of luck my boys it’s back against the wall yet again."
jerax is legit a god
"Every now and then, I watched true sight because it gives me the most hype."
They win as a team
"This is just simply masterpiece, more I watch more I get hooked to it."
CEB IS FUCKING GOD!
ANA GOD PLEASE COMEBACK
ceb its real
"Anything before covid strikes. 😭 The crowd, the commentator, the player, and the game itself is what I missed."
"""Ceb axe? MonkaS"""
"literally no one...





Notail: smoke a cigarette at no smoking area with a sign"
"Fan at 58:46: ""Take your revenge next year!""
OG: ""Nope. Aegis still ours."""
55:35 Happy Chinese New Year!
"ceb is a good leader, the motivation, plans and trust that the team had. everything is just beautiful. Even though ana and topson are carrying the game, but ceb is the one pulling everyone together in fucking minds. Love the OG teamplay so much man. highest respect to Ceb"
Nice movie
cpsg fans mostly chinese SPAIN but S is silent hehehehe
"This is why i love og, how they support each other is truly amazing even they lose a point behind but ceb is unbelieveable.. he is such a strong individual who keeps his teammate has a positive vibe. No matter they win or lose game, i will keep support OG"
"Чел перед 4 игрой сказал сомнусу, чтоб тот снял кофту, если выйграют ти8. Сомнус заранее снял и проебал, понимаю😁"
2 years later.. .. Still the best underdog story and the great game ever watched
The best true sight out of all
This ti8 truesight always motivate us don't give up on dreams no matter what happen
Fy said : he...
"I know how painful it is LGD,
You just look them down in every game.
Now you will look them up.."
The more i watch this the more i think Ame cost them the aegis
this is still the best true sight imo
"I look, I remember these times now.  So happy for them, as if the International itself won.  Even more)"
Anyone still watching this ♥️? the hype on this game will always be recorded in history ♥️
"Notail got so emotional 
While Ana : I have to play my part"
Chalice was like the capt. actually HAHAHA
Hanszimner 💀
memes???
"55:40 When FY said ""fireworks thudding"" i really felt that"
5:41 LMAO
still watching this man. can't wait for TI10 True Sight.. ♥
"God knows how much ive watched this video and how its still so nostalgic wholesome, emotional ,funny and satisfying"
"Ti8 Topson: erm... I dont know...
Ti9 Topson: Pick me.... pick me pugna"
2k21
"I've watch this more then 5times, but I still can't get over it. Both teams were just great."
"51:42 finally, Ame speaks. I thought he is mute HAHAHAHAHAH"
This was the only play style which was based on trust not anything else 🙂
"52:38 man that TB  running scared is priceless, It almost killed me 🤣🤣"
Could anyone please tell me the music used at 35:00
"This is second to none, OG was cemented themselves as a legend on dota scene forever, idk what people say but even haters gonna cry seeing this true sight.
Imagine, OG is only a team who pick up the scraps before TI at vancouver, almost disband 2 months before TI, picking up ana and also the pub star topson who got no achievement no record of major tournament, and they still pull it out together.
I love how they communicate, how ceb is so calm yet so motivated, notail with his knowledge and kindness, jerax with his smile, Ana with his positivity and Topson with his silence but deadly gesture.
This shouldve been the best run on TI and will always be.
Fairytale that comes to reality.
Now Without jerax once again OG need to defence their 2 times TI Champion in front of big crowd."
tf!
Is it just me or the Chinese guy on the caster's desk laughs when LGD is winning a fight and he won't show any emotion when OG is winning
"Who comes back for Godson? Love the transformation, u my inspiration."
"""Guys, win or lose, we don't care, we play""

The best word i have ever heard today.."
oppa oppa boys voice chat anyone?
"Now I get why other people see this win as luck even if it's not
OG's super chill atmosphere can sometimes be seen as they're not caring about the game enough and lucked their way through
But in reality that super chill atmosphere can only be attained with their team being totally ok with losing. Playing like there's nothing to lose and playing to have fun with your closest friends takes the stress off for everyone and you can see how they just blindly trust each other knowing that win or lose its just a game and they're just happy to play
TI8 is really really well played"
Seeing Jerax laugh at Notail and Ceb cursing is amazing. 😂
8:36 I feel so nerdy watching haha
Hopefully if you play so much Dota 2 will you be physically fit?
Who still watch this OG moment... Leave some like if u look this :)
im gonna be honest...i was crying and banging my room for og's victory.....I MEAN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE
"If there is a run towards a championship more epic, with more ups and downs, a better revenge story, than this one in any sport, I haven’t heard of it"
"Ceb: You want invoker ?
Topson : Yea 
Ceb: Give the boy his invoker
MC: I beg you , I wanna pick nature prophet , we are at the finals because of it and I'm the best player of the Ti because of it 
Kuro: No."
Felt bad about FY losing he is a pos 4 monster.
Fvck the animation i want to see the real fight -_-
"""I can't come, I have a documentary to watch"", a sentence I thought I'd never use."
Go home LGD 👌😃
55:12 seeing notail trying to not scream his lungs out. the emotion.
"topson: feels bad man, feels bad man
notail: what? what do you mean? 
this is why i love notail and ceb they're not blaming any of their teammate if they fuck up"
Im just here to repeat this 14:45
"A Wise man once said
""Their play is messy, so messy, all dumbasses"""
"Compare to True Strike TI9, TI8 is so much worst, if with the New one, you can easily track the game and player mod, also the crowd, in this video, Dota2 scene is too little to catch up. Glad they make the change in new one."
"36:00 He's just standing there, *MENACINGLY*"
I really doesnt fucking matter just end the game 🥲
Is this Axe performance ?
17:44 NO SMOKING SIGN
That's phoenix awesome
OG’s legendary legacy is second to none. Perhaps their success can never be replicated again. I strongly believe their Dota is the best that ever existed in the sport — no meta or game strat can ever level to their very cohesive play style built on trust. I just love the way they play.
Noob Chinese
"Psg was clearly the best team technically, but dota is a sport, and the imprevisible happened that day."
55:14 notail takes a deep breath as it started dawning on him that he’s about to finally win TI and fulfill his dream
"""They f** up"" HAHAHAH ti8-ti9 should be on the chat wheel"
52:14 hair
fuk it just take it -ceb 2018
My heart beats for OG ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Lost my dad … this game showed me that you can get up after you fall
This anna topson and jerax are OP. 3 GO GO GO players. Soo good to watch even until now. With ceb and notail who match the pacing.... Spectacular team
im just here today coz my existence feels like ti10 should be at this season. damn
12:42 bro that dint age well
44:00
When FY said “Teams that win game 1 always lose the finals. That is a prophecy to team liquid in ti9 lol 🤣
"Among Top 10 quotes before a disaster: ""Where is Axe?"" 😛😛"
"2021 still the Best TI ever!!!!!
Goosebumps everywhere..."
55:38 insert sad music*
tusk king my ass🤣
This why they are two times TI Winners. They really a team.
Why am i crying? HAHAHAHA!
"'I feel bad for them...Fuck them, I don't feel bad for them""- Ceb"
Still the best true sight and TI ever
this is the best TI final in a decade. I hope to see a better final in ti10
China sucks
"40:00 ceb: on est sur l enerve= we are on edge.
notail; on est sur les meres = we are on moms.
i lost it x))"
"""Teams that win in game 1 always lose the finals."" lmao"
I need this on Netflix. I would pay to watch this on Netflix.
"""wheres axe?"" moment before a disaster"
is there a chat wheel for this? 30:59
"i can really feel ceb & notail's grit in here 30:59, meanwhile Jerax is laughing at them haha"
37:28 classic jerax haha
holycrap ceb is holding a bunch of papers!
"China sure like talk big and then lose. So funny look they too proud win the 2nd and 3rd game... YES OG GO HOME BUT WIN, AND YOU?"
I think this really shows the power of a good attitude. OG didn't let their losses faze them too much but LGD did.
"5:29 Coach asked ""which shoulder is it man?""

Context:
former OG teammate Cr1t, shoulder checked Notail while they were on their way back to their rooms and EG(cr1t's new team) were going the other way. The shoulder checked looked intentional, management said it isnt."
"ceb is really good as captain, being near him  i just can feel the positive aura"
"Watching more than 10 times over and over again , i still get the chills that they might lose in this game 4"
"Bruh i swear Fy is the only member who is always positive in each situation, he doesn't blame anyone or anything. I want this man to win his ti"
29:50 cute girl
"34:07 yes they go home 




But with trophy"
This moment where the weird draft strat being use all time nowadays. Respect OG
"LGD crowd chanting Go Home OG, yet OG went home with the Aegis🤷‍♂️"
"""OG.....YOUR TI8 CHAMPION!!!!!

Dude That's Fking Awesome"
THE OPTIMISTIC TRAIT OF OG EVEN IF THEY LOSE THEY DONT BLAME EACH OTHER❤️ gold
that camera shot tho at 0:45 is scary
"Im the one who watching here,,every day.. I miss Ana."
Does anyone have insider info on the pants Notail talks about at 02:32 I want some
14:45 kunn-kaaa
"I don’t play dota, but whenever I need some light in my live I watch this…"
"Wait lol, Topson has never won a Major yet he’s won 2 TI’s"
Love re-watching this and reading the comments with you guys
I don't even know how many times I have watched this
The difference in their mind set is what plays big in this series
"Make no mistake, this psg-lgd was the best of the best."
Fuck ceb fuck notail
"My assignment is about to due, but I am here, and i nvr played dota before :o"
CeB mk that guy a prophet
This will never happen again. So better watch it over and over again.
"Played first dota for 6 years and League for 11, but this vid brought me back to DotA 2"
This one is still the best True sight ever. So emotional
We wait for the TI 20-21
55:40 mood
"I’ve watched this over and over again no matter how many times have i rewatched it . It always gives me goosebumps when they won the TI 
#LONGLIVEOG"
"I was thinking, how does it feel to be those guys at the back of each team. Watching pros play."
watching this awesome documentary again as they proceed to ti10 with a new roster
44:06 🔥
It's fucking hilarious to me that these guys are outside smoking cigarettes like tweakers in between matches.
10:11 is that saksa?
Damn shít I literally just watched this now out of nowhere thinking about OG's legendary story! I don't care anymore if they won't win TI this year they already proved themselves but hey I'd like them to have the 3-peat!!!!!!!!
Just finished watching this game. It's a TI curse for us to watch this. Hahaha.
"When they pick TB
Ana : ""do you think ember's still good ?""
ceb : depends what wanna fuck them with
Notail : slark ?
Ana : go ember -_-"
"Watch the team talks after each game, LGD talked mostly about in-game analysis or mistakes, OG was all about motivation and chill the f out and that's how you win"
"That burst of happiness and relief when n0tail and topson screamed and while the whole OG team celebrated then it switched to LGD with fireworks in the background, DAMN! the feels. What a roller coaster of emotions. If you have ever competed to the highest level that you can, you know the feeling."
I watched this a lot of times but only now I noticed that NOTAIL raised the aegis without his shoes on.
52:52 just look at jerax’s facial expression
"that ""chinesse"" caster must be still crying at nights"
This one really hits different every time. 🔥👌
will come back to this comment if they win TI this year again for the 3rd time :) #DreamOG
Go home OG started in Vancouver ???? Lmao I thought it started in Shanghai Ti9
BUGOK FY TUSK KING? HAHAHAH
"this video production is just amazing, the cuts, the editing, especially the scoring!!! fucking good! OG is just an amazing team, win or lose."
"48:28
Ana: Who has the better late game timing?
Ceb: We do because we're better.

Ceb really boosted their morale all throughout the series! What a very positive playing coach."
idiot china
can't wait for Ti10
#Thankyouflysacrificeforcreatenewlegend
Give the boy invoker.
"Damn.. jerax really giving out all the right calls.. 31:28  ceb just wants to take mid tower straight up but jerax insisted on on the wrap around instead and they got the kill 52:01 Man up! after losing the team fight and lgd was taking rosh, jerax again insisted in contesting rosh and reminded them echo and global silence is on cd. I hope someone is making the right calls for OG on TI10 i dont think saksa has the balls to disagree with ceb or notail but we'll see. I just wanna see OG mic'd up and see their interactions now that they have saksa and sumail. Good luck boys"
"Go home OG
With A win🖤"
jerax won them 2 TIs
i feel bad for the losing side in every game.
Watching this again coz OG secure their slot at TI10.
52:52 Jerax already know they are gonna win!
"Notail: NICE!!!!
Ceb: My ears 

Fcking hilarious 🤣"
"-do you think ember so good?
-depends on you wanna f**k them with (ceb best motivator)"
Somnus and Anna looks very similar
"'No one will remember the second place,'"
I need someone to give me the song name at 07:30
Both teams are fucking rude
It's TI10! It's time to review!
Back here after that OG and Tundra Finals
Watching after OG qualified for TI and the chance to defend their two time championship. And also Somnus and FY vs Xnova and Chalice with different teams fighting to get qualified while Ame's watching at home the only one left from that LGD squad clearly the favorite to win this year.
SUMAIL ON #dota2carry
Who's here after OG winning TI qualifiers?
who's here after OG qualify for TI10?
Who watch this again after  watching weu qualifier finals? Let's go 3peat bois!
BEST MOMENT 30:58
Just had to come back here after OG going through TI 10 Qualifiers :) This is where their crazy story all started in a way
Disgusting chinese fan
"Кто после квалификаций на TI10, где ОГ отобрались и едут за 3 аегисом?Это будет историческое дермище, пацаны!!!"
"45:12 I'm new, so why is tb bad against a pos 3 NP?"
"19:43 notail : Chen PL
everyone : yeahhhhhh"
38:45 is what ur looking for
Topson.... worst invoker as well as best invoker XD
"2:43

Ana be like : ""Oh shit there's a camera, act natural."""
XAXAXAXA3XAXAXA3
49:00
I really really miss the crowd at TI
I hope someday i would be part of OG Esports
PSG LGD noober haahahha noob GO GO OG
ffk why am i still crying
"I come here every now and then to get inspiration. OG always tells me that no matter how hard life is, you just gotta believe in yourself and the impossible can be possible. Thank you OG!"
"Damn, funny how a year later, LGD came with the biggest comeback in history - COVID."
It is a tradition to come back here once in a week.
44:04
The coocky silent in the end.
"Anjing gw masih kesel liat para **** lgd sombong, bangsat. Padahal udah 2021. Oante"
Am i the only one that still watching this?
31:00 can you guys spell that what notail said pls i need that
"Played like friends.
Won like friends."
el psg es pecho frio hasta en dota gaa
This is a Masterpiece.
You gotta love that arrogant smile hits the floor.
"I quit dota2 8yrs ago , but it doesn't mean im not a fan anymore . Still watch Dota in any tournaments . This one is the greatest tournament and the greatest TI of alltime .. ❤️"
55:13 when notail couldn't believe that it's happening years of hard work paid off the look on his face was like it's really happening we did it
"2021 and we pay a ticket to watch some nerds  playing video gmaes,,,still our present civilization doesnt know how pyramids were build...imagine what would the past delevoped civilizations say about us ...and we all believe that using a Pc or a smartphone makes us smart..we are much more primitive than before..RIP human kind..hope tha NWO will come soon and it will eradicate stupidity from this earth"
38:48 CEEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBBBB He gets the call of his lifetime!
Eat shit LGD
quien juega dota no ve el coño
who plays dota doesn't see pussy
QUEM JOGA DOTA NAO VE XOTA .
GGWP!!!!!!
52:14 23 savage
This series is one the most memorable because even the crowd was not on their side and even the casters were all in on lgd but even still they did what no one thought possible and won with their unique play and teamwork.
"Need a Netflix series on Dota Ti8!!! 
Someone create a petition."
Still watching. One of the greatest scene in TI
Ana looks like he fucking won a round of bingo
"I'm not crying man, you are"
38:08
Ceb is holding a bunch of paper.... Hahahaha
WEST EU FTW
It's time to watch again...
Tbh the way they make this film / movie etc. Is so good and inspiring wtf
Menedzher-san! Zdes' tozhe mnogo vsego.
Fy was the mvp. This guy is a machine
"The difference 
OG - good leadership, trust in their teammates is unremarkable, win or lose doesnt matter to them coz its already done just ready for the next one.

LGD - kinda toxic, their still thinking the game after they lose which is not good. Always cocky before the game lol."
i think is the fifth time that i'm watching this and the 2019 finals
5 Coworkers vs 1 Fucking Team
"in 4th match 30 mins.
Such a loser crowd"
52:13
i reincarnated as pro gamer an join OG
"Aside from the magnificent gameplay and the competition itself, this vid has a very masterly editing"
"Crowd: Go home OG

And go home they did.. With Aegis in their arms."
"The game comes down to half a second, when you can't predict what's going to happen... that's exactly when my potato network decides to lag"
40:19 him smile right there is truly one of happiness and satisfying moment for jerax.
36:00 its me when the enemy team try to go HIghground HAHAHHAHAA
"Caution: if you watch this you'll end up watching ""Ti9 true sight"" and ""OG comeback to win ti8"""
This is why you dont need to look like scary team let your play show how scary you guys are
Every time LGD laughs at The Picks of Og they Lose 🤣🤣🤣
Go home OG 😂
bro i like how they added the short animation thats lit
Dream to play ti🤑❤❤❤
"Ana the GOAT, The Legend, The IO God and The Ember God"
34:09 Audience: Go home OG.... how rude... bruh
"Ana: Ceb it’s real 
Earlier
Ana: who’s got the better late game 
Ceb: we cause we’re fucking better"
49:47
nanti nanges
the power of friendship
"39:48
44:04
58:56
OG sound bundle spring-summer 2021"
"Is this guy for real. Lol that fuking guy is a genius. Paying such unconventional heroes and winning TI's. The whole team spirit and the brotherhood that OG brings along. Unbeatable. Johan, ceeeb, jerax, ana, top fuking son."
45:29 the moment that sealed the deal for them tbh
damn how Ana coulnt get into Major in 2021 with OG and in the past 2018 he could pass the pressure of the fan scream : GO HOME OG
I still really hope somnus (god mid) win TI one day
Ceb mentality is elite..he got the positivity in his mind is perfect

I love this game so much i want to pl~y it again motiv~ted
"QQQ: What use is PL?

29:50 this is something for myself
Definately smoked before final game
I miss this ana who loves DotA.
ME GUSTARÍA VER UN TEAM PERUANO EN LA FINAL DE UNA Ti🇵🇪❤️
"Well played dota, i think play this today"
"Well played, i never play dota but this video es incredible. Dota is awesome"
"Ceb on Axe: you gonna see some shit man

And yup, the most historical moment in Dota, the call of his life, Ceeeeeeeeeeeeb"
55:18
38:47 still the best.
"Ana: ""Whose got better late game""
Ceb: ""We do, cause we are better""

omegalul"
"What a great game, GG's Indeed"
2:47 what was ana alt tabing?..

"Я не знаю нафига, но...))
39:47 Dude, I love this game so much, man!
44:06 Lose together, win together, slay together, slay together, slay together
58:56 I can’t believe it"
39:18 Honest Ana
Watching this again because Ana retires from dota 😢
"I watch this on 16-6-2021 to remember OG.ANA !!! Go OG, Good Luck to your future Ana"
Watching this for the final time for Ana. Dota would never be the same again
BECAUSE OF TIKTOK I NEED TO REWATCH THIS
Now this even hits hard.
mann ana will be missed
rewatched this one after ana announces his retirement
"The complacency, arrogance, and over confidence is what brought LGD to their defeat. They even laugh at Ceb bringing paper for their planned draft. This recent animajor I saw their (LGD)coach bringing a piece of ""paper"" everytime they draft. I believe they realize that drafting heroes is like playing chess."
9:15
Does anyone know how to spell we are on edge in french? (12:33)
"LGD when they are losing, tilting each other, OG losing motivating each other."
I feel emotional ANa is retiring but again i saw a how legend was born
"N0 tail true OG lol, smoking cigarette in front of don't smoke sign 17:39 :D"
"Came back here after hearing ana's retirement. 

Just want to experience the whole OG magic again."
I swear to god I don't even play dota but I've lost count on how many times I watch this
Who's there after Ana announce his retirement?
im back here because ana retired :(
Came here after ana announced his retirement. Best carry in my opinion
"Who's watching because Ana retires?
👇"
"Rewatching this after Ana god announced his retirement from Pro Scene. 
Great games from both teams."
Goodbye ana o7
Cinderella story
"See you again, Ana."
THANK YOU ANA!
Who is here after Ana announced retirement?
Who comeback here just to watch ana play game 😭
I don't really know or play this game (my ancient machinery can't run it) but are they like the SKT of DOTA???
"the ember god rest now, good bye humblegod thanks for the games"
46:03
"GOODBYE AND THANKS OG.ana.bit, THE INDIFFERENT PRODIGY 🌻"
Bye ana
Best fucking TI of all time! Looking forward for a 3peat!!!!!
Im here coz ana retired😭😭
happy retirement ana. glhf 🌻
"the subs were not accurate, like lgd were saying stuff like calling og ""dumbfucks"", stuff similar to ""fuck your mom"" and stuff along these lines but they got censored out. subs shouldnt rephrase things they say to make them seem nicer"
"Its funny how Fy said, ""Teams that win game 1, always lose to finals"", and later he ate his cocky words. This might be too old, but this whats make ti8 great and true sight just got me goosebumps and chills. What a show!

Ps, I laughed when one says from lgd took off their jackets once they win the last match, bro dont count the chicks as if they already hatched 🤣. Lmao"
38:47 man wished they included the crowrd’s roars when ceb axe callllll
Guys I have watched both ti8 true sight and red bull og documentary but I can’t decide which one is better. Which one do u guys thihk is better?!
38:24 thank me later
OG keep on trying! There is still a chance in qualifier this year. Lets repeat thiz miracle again
18:23 WTF is that?? Adderall?
9:25 funny moment somnus
"I just realized when LGD casted Global Silence, the Chinese audience got affected.

I know. it's 2021 and im still watching this."
38:42 You just unleashed the beast
"my man Jerax ""That call, that was some kreygasm shit"" 39:00"
no smoking area notail
Fy god
"14:05 
""I feel bad for them""
""Whatever i dont feel bad for them fuck 'em"""
Team og the only legend of dota2 history
This TI has a lot of highlights. So damn epic
28:56 it really is boi
"The  fretful feet intraspecifically produce because maria parallely add upon a substantial bench. spiteful, obedient knight"
Psychology played a huge role here. The game 4 completely broke LGD emotionally.
Im chinese，and Im FXXXING dislike that rubbish attitude from lgd if u guys really understand what they say，thanks god filter by translator
Ppasarel has a good aura. ❤️
43:01 with that music seems more sad :c
Jerax so good man!
17:40 anyone notice notail smoking on no-smoking area? 😂
"Hahahaha that game 5 shocks the psg at roshan, and having a silent for a moment 😂🤣"
"Mr. Ching supporters: ""Go home OG""
OG: *takes aegis home
Mr. Ching supporters: ........."
31:01 jerax reaction to notail and ceb..🤣🤣
"48:27 that ceb mindset, can lift your anxiety"
"dont mind me, just inhaling copium"
"37:29 jerax ""Ana u wanna relo into their base? Memes?"" 
           ana: ""fuck off"""
"39:05 when Ana play PL GOD-MODE
Jerax ""Ana, say if u get Ruptured because then i wanna relo u out""
Ana ""yeah sure. I don't even know what the fucks going on, i can't even see my own hero""

All team laughing😂"
Jerax laughing.. Must be thinking.. What's is wrong with this guy 😂😂😂
"The last clip of n0tail about winning TI + the piano = chills man, every damn time"
"I think in the 8 years I've played this game and the Ti's I've been here for, this. This was the all time best one ever. Ti9 is a close second but the underdog taking the cake, the whole dynamics, the way it played out. You could not explain the feeling of watching this live to someone with all it entailed"
"Did Notail just screamed "" P*ta"" in 31:02? XD"
In ranked matches every time I face against a 3 man Chinese party the are smurfs but when I have 3 man Chinese party in my team they’re such noobs and 10 iq players
uno de los mejores finales de los TI!!!!!!!!!!!!
Massive respect for Ceb what a great leader
7:21 never forgive never forget
i watched ti8 & ti9 for 4 times now.
"music on 54:30? someone, guys"
man! true sight made me love dota even more.
What's the background song at 7:20?
Its 2021 and Im still confused why AME dont have camera xposure hahaha
53:06 shocked
Best coach and IGL ceeeeeeeeeeb
"Fy is great
But jerax is just god"
Ceb was so in control in bringing them back into the game... Well played
"2021, still BEST TI ever!"
"- Спустя столько лет?
- Всегда"
"My friend was there, he was so disappointed when LGD lost"
I cant se notail as captain
"Out of these 3 true sight 
It's the best ❤️"
The ending is happy and sad at the same time
I know Mandarin and what PSG said throughout the game against OG is way more meaner than the translation lol
39:49 dude i love this game so much man
How come ceb didn't play for so long until that year ? He was a below average player that's why he started coaching. It's very impressive how he played the best dota he ever played at TI.
"“Topson is this guys for real?”
How every protagonist is born"
"I don't even play dota, yet I already watch this 3 times 😂 now it's the 4th."
Kunkka
Came here after watching animajor
When life feels impossible I just thank the higher powers that I was born in the Western part of the world and that YouTube clips will always be narrated in my favor.
sound the king is back . minute?
"who watch in 2021,3rd june"
"How to shout in silent.

Just look at ana 😂"
"Holy shit, OG is fucking unbreakable and Ceb is the absolute man."
looking forward to 3x TI
31:00 is the best part
4th time
18:51
best chingchoke crown in dota 2 history HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
notail learning the importance of jeggings
The crucial point was ceb's axe and his belief he will carry that game. And he did.    He was like a fanatic who won't admit defeat. The way he cursed in french was hilarious though 😆
i have watched this more than 10 times..and its still interesting
Ana is the best!!!!
"""if you break the other mind, It's really easy ... Some minds are really hard to break though""
damn this quote from NoTail gets me goosebumps every time I hear it."
everytime i watch this video i always get goosebumps
hasta los mas pros hace cosas de noobs xdd
mucha presion jugar una final contra chinos
CN dota，best dota !  ti10，今年一定要夺冠啊!💪🇨🇳
39:49
59:43 When you drop bottle
"Ceb : You're gonna see some shit man
*Later in the game*
""CEEEEEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"""
8:12 can someone tell what the background song is?
"LGD is a team so full of themselves... While OG is a team full of motivation and teamwork... Huge difference, huge outcome. 😁😁😁"
I play league for almost 8 yrs and I think it'll be much better if I invest in dota lol
"45:28 notail said slark, but ana said go ember go ember, from here we can see, how OG trust teammate each other, and put ember in pos 1, i like this team :)"
"Ladies and Gentlemen , this is DoTA"
I feel sad for that flying key though
can't stop watching thiss 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 the curse is realllllllll
"Bad edit , better if shown more fights then showing audience and players"
"What I love about OG is that they loved their fans, unlike LGD"
38:24 that dude's face hahahahaha
"TI 8 JAMAN DIMANA RUSMAN BELUM NGOMONG ELU SETAN,APA ITU LEE,APA INII,APA ITUU, KENAPA ITUU LEEE"
Can someone translate Ceb's French pls. 31:00
55:43 best part of the game 5 haha
Goback china go fuckin home
"Fans : "" Takes your revenge next year""

OG : ""What?"""
Kesini karna dapat info dari channel mas eko😕

"TI9 Team Intro but its 3 hours!!!
https://youtu.be/G25yur2yO1I"
Ceb is a great leader
I think I like sus
"The crowd can call go home OG all they want , they wont budge because they have eachother , look at LGD they just broken after losing a fight ."
31:00
31:01
31:04
"52:50  Ana:woo

Ti10 closed qualifers og again here we go!
Did I just watch a 1 hour feature on a game that I haven't played my entire life? Sheesh🔥
"36:46 if watch in full game, the actually turning point is this called from ceb that gain their momentum back."
14:45
55:36 i feel this guy.
"6:33 a bunch of papers"" ahaha gooood"
i kept watchin this epic game epic team OG for life.
12:41 fy predict the 2019 international
"I can see Ana he’s different between TI8 and TI9. 
TI8 he’s more activity and happier 
TI9 he’s look so stressed."
"Man, i just laugh at topson at 3:52. He just like a anime guy that dont have any power, but yeah now he is so badass just like anime guy."
"after all this years, I still get goosebumps"
The difference in mentality. Chalice trashtalking and chilling while og was stressingnthings  out
"Jerax, please come back"
48:24 stay strong boys
19:40 - 19:47 is so wholesome man
52:52 topson: 🤬 --> 😐
31:02 any French friends wanna write down what Ceb said? (in French)
3:46 what a tension.
"There, Possibility in the impossible. Belive ~"
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB
"42:01 ceb's goosebumping motivation!



37:50 also topson's funny scream moment XD"
mana take revenge next uear? orang next yearnya kalah lagi aowaowkaokwaokwakooakwoakowkaokwaokawokaokaokaw
"man im a chinese and I feel so ashamed for lgd, after they lost 1st match they didn't try to look upon their mistake and just called og using cheese strat like treant when they literally had alot of missplays"
the true leader has been shown by Ceb at 3:55 hopefully i can meet him personally
love watching the chinese take an L
39:40 why is there a kid waiving the USA's flag like there's no American in that team lmao
31:27 Jerax - i wanna take you bottom i wanna take you bottom watch this. SO MUCH TRUST. This is why i love OG.
29:41 I REALLY LOVE THIS SHIT!!!!
Its like im watching the english version of the Karate Kid 🤣 Asian antagonists. Clips were really handpicked and put together really well :)
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
"""Go home OG"" what a disrespectful behavior shame on you who do you think you're talking to ? IT'S BACK TO BACK TI CHAMPION 🏆 dudeee now we see who's going now then 😏🤫"
"if I was in the og position, I would cry
if i was in lgd position, i would cry too"
"15:08 “invoker is a pig, bros.” 
As a native Chinese speaker, great translation! XD"
31:00
"fajne, szkoda ze nie po polsku ale dobrze ze chinczyki sie splakaly xD"

berlagak sgt. kan dah menang...gung kekalahan
"OG Mental game strategy: Lakad Matataaaaaaaaag! Normalin Normalin, Oyoyooyoyoyoyoyoyoy, ECHO SLAMMA JAMMAAAA!!!"

"Welcome back, og fans! Sniff this video in full."

Ceeeb:Anna ember .. 😆
De best phonix moved
i like it when china gets rekt
"This is how i love the draft phase, they are predecting the whole game"
I know you're here for this 44:05
"Every break:
OG cheer and uplift each other.
LGD blame on every misplays."
"CANT GET ENOUGH OF THIS, ITS SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!"
"wow just realised an animation mistake at 36:36 when axe is tping to rejoin the fight, the t1 and t2 bot towers are still up but in the actual game it was pushed all the way to t3"
Watching this for nth time I just realized that Ana and Jerax have this memed love-hate relationship. hahahah
"For me who can't afford PC and just playing mobile games, this is some serious shit🔥🔥🔥"
"31:27 thats the jerax wisdom, thats the jerax genius"
please some1 has to translate everything ceb is saying in french
fuckingmad is seriously a god. hes so underrated i truly believe OG would not have won 2 TI's without his leadership
Time to rewatch this masterpiece I guess
38:39 - where's axe? CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB!!!!!!!!
Oh fans here after the lose yesterday?
Auto mute eh
14:39 They picked invoker. What do we want against him? Kunkka
ana is not use to smoking
"Crowd: Go home OG!!
OG: yeaaaaaaaahhhhh 😂"
39:08
44:06 That OG
44:05
🎆fy🎆
Still the best TI Final ever
"somnus: i can steal the aegis
somnus: [comes in]
jerAx: [echo slam]
wtf??? he's so fcccckinggg goooddd!!"
Sarap sa feeling. ❌🇨🇳❌
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
That moment when Ana is just watching YouTube HAHAHHAHA
SAME GOOSEBUMPS EVEN THO YEARS HAVE PASSED
OG’s secret: 40:27
*LAKAD MATATAAAAAAAG*
that sarcastic all trust on you man
17:40 is anyone notice notail smoking infront No Smoking sign
Super!
go home coronaaa
"LGD Fans: Go Home OG

OG Fans: Comeback Cry HAHAHA"
xNova's macro calls are on point. Sad that he seems to be not heard by his team.
"Ceb with his Axe: they gonna see some shit man


He ain't lying"
Legend says that up to this point LGD still wears their jacket.
"one word, ""CHOKE"""
western vs china
ana is so fcking unpredictable
Win or lose; we don't care we play
"LGD fans : "" Go Home OG!"" 
And ... OG's win the round LOL"
两边素质拉满
"Notail always give me a hope. Someday i will be success like him, no matter how hard life is."
55:36 finally found the meme
"jerax so good, topson too"
"I already cry watching this... I'm so happy for them what a great team, what a great mindset, what great people they are. Amazing!"
Yes thanks OG for fking them up!!!
Nice video
"Even JerAx doubted Ceb's Ace pick.
The guy really did the unthinkable against ""Tusk King""."
"I just love how OG be like ""No pressure guys, just vibe it"" in the entire series."
"I still can't get over LGD defeat in TI8. They're  the rightful winner of Ti 8. A combination of complacency, underestimating their opponent , poor decision making and turtling tactic from OG caught them by surprise. CN really need to win the next TI to exorcise this defeat."
"""Where is axe"" still gets me every time"
The LGD players are so toxic I bet they were trained by SEA players hahaha
Here I am again. Someone with me?
i love how they crush this douchebags
"okay, somehow keep watching this every once in a while, just gonna says, outside of it all, shout out to all the commentator, they makes the game more lively and exciting, easier to follow."
Fy looks like sumiya
Somebody tell me why they always ban drow ranger
52:49 miss that feeling.
"power of friendship is not made up, kids"
"You can tell, OG was just mentally tougher. They went through it so many times that they're pretty much built for the stress of it all and they conquered it"
52:56 that reaction from fy. you can feel his disappointment from what happened.
i hate asian
"The Chinese people always make us underestimate,but its not make us down. They just make us more powerful to prove if we are more better than they think"
"You can literally see the moment N0Tail realises he is about win TI, the way he gets a lump in his throat it even makes me emotional"
26:31 WHY THE FUCK WOULD THEY GIVE THEM IO oh wait wrong ti
55:12 GOD!! I love this moment 😏
"LGD purchase wards: WWWWOOOOAAAHHHH YEAAAHHHHH!!!! ( Crowds go wild like brrrrrrr )

OG Wiped out these cocky ""no chill"" LGD and win TI. : Global silence activate."
"Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb, He gets the Call, of his lifetime!"
35:50
"this makes me cry like this video has so much going in it , the emotions the process, everything is just so crazy."
im rewatching this again and i want to punch each of the shits shouting go home og
50:45 even the spectator was relieved when ana survived
Does anyone notice at 19:42 ceb and notail said Chen PL at the same time ?
Rewatching this for like 20th time for the past 3 years thinking what if it was me.
"If i want to get inspired when i lose focus in my life i just watch this to reset my confidence. My life is always at the bottom people always look down on me my life is basically like OG the best asset that i have is confidence and nothing else. To those underdogs in real life out there remember your best asset is confidence some people ofc is better than you but they lack confidence like LGD this documentary mirrors our life. 

#Keepfighting"
Jerax: MAN UP!
The learning curve for this game must be steep but watching this makes me wanna try out Dota 2
"Уже 3 года прошло. Карл, 3 года"
Fucking shit. Jinxed it. 😂😂😂
"Jerax didn't seem to talk much, but every time he did it was perfect.. not joking, the guy has a 6sense for the game"
OG really played with thier heart in this series. And they played this series for the Love of the game. Specially in game 4 and 5.
"""How dare they pick Axe in fron of the ""Tusk King""""
Wow! The arrogance.. Im glad it was Axe that shut Tusk King up! Lol"
somnus looks like he wanna smack the hell out of chalice lmao guy was so noisy
Here we go again
52:47 All the smug and sneering faces are wuipped out from the face of their l
amazing
"4:22 damn that microphone like 15ft away from them but the audio as u can hear, its really clear"
I dnt play dota 2 anymore but still i watch and believe in OG
2021 and still here
May 2021
@52:12 moonmeander is trying to cheer for OG.
"already watched this 4x. not even counting the clips. OG was so full of team spirit and only focus game after game. LGD really fucked up.  watched the whole TI and really thought that LGD would win this TI but guess what, they got so full of themselves. they even got the time to mocked on OG. maybe that's how karma works?"
38:43 WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
"It's hard seeing faces of losing team, I mean so heartbreaking. When you realize that all the celebration happening outside is not for you, people cheering not for you, it hurts."
"Both teams are cool, so I'm glad for OG too, but I really wanted fy to win :("
"Still give me chills everytime I rewatch this masterpiece, a legendary clutch indeed."
"LGD: ""fuckn hell, spectre is so badass""  😂"
Damn topson looks old and unhealthy in here
9:15 oppa oppa bois
Get Jerax back and win three in a row
"I alwaya rewatch this masterpiece, if smth goes wrong in my life. Empowering me."
41:43: That shrug. This where they lost...
Rp means??
52:52
52:51
52:50
"OST around 58:17
PLEASE THANK YOU :("
I've watched this everyday for the past week straight. I have no regrets.
Ceb best captain
STILL THE BEST TI BY FAR. MAD RESPECT FOR OG
There's something magical about TI8 that I can't put into words.
April 2021 still watching this inspiring cinderalla story ☺️❤️
"27:31
: They wont pick invoker again.
They just did
Ahh?!"
China is such a trashtalker thats why they got a karma
watched it so many times that I practically memorized all the dialogues...BEST TI ever....
I still wonder what fly felt when he witnessed the team he left win ti.
"Ceb: cursed in French

jerax: laughing out loud - doesn't understand a thing!!"
11:33 zai special appearance
10 million views! Finally!
"Out of all TI's this is where I learn the most not to give up easily and also the most emotional movie ive ever seen, Ceb really is a tough guy, he's an MVP of speaking the truth. OG is the best team and that's a fact"
"""Team that wins game 1 always lose the finals""
Kuro : Damn true."
Ceb is the true homie that really wants to see his bros succeed and sincerely happy for them. Look how he isnt about himself but rather always trying for the team. Bruh look at the way he is with notail especially. Geez guy has such a good personality that everyone can take from.
there is sucha thing as good losers my respects
"It's crazy how og even thinks of such ballzy builds that too in the ti finals 🔥
I guess this happens when u have achieved team coordination complete game sence and weird teammates😂 who would undoubtedly trust ur any decision😂 
Just think about it other teams work hard to master game mechanics coordination etc at the same time og just picks up a weird support and converts it into an absolute nightmare carry which destroys the entire enemy lineup 
🔥hats off og 🔥"
Too overconfident on psg lgd tbh
Ceb the real MVP
"DAMN, LGD FEELS LIKE A TEAM MORE THAN NIGMA EVEN THOUGH NIGMA ALREADY WON TI"
"LGD : we must win this ! 
Ceb : I JUST WANT TO PLAY DOTA!DOTA!DOTA!"
chills overflow my body at 35:38 when the crowd supporting OG were holding their breaths with gaze of hope GAME 4 for OG to continue their fights with com back !!!
Banana ?Banana ?
"TI8 Final game and topson picks zeus, what a ultimate meme machine"
Ceb is the real carry
Still get goosebumps watching this. Beautiful stories were made out of this.
That’s the only thing I care about this game ‘ Jerax at his best pos.4!!too good to handle for lgd
31:00 ceb and N0tail each cursing in French and Danish respectively is gloriously cathartic
Where's TI10?
Who else came here to cry?
tusk king? lul
I've watched the true sight of ti9 couple of times but this is my 1st time watching this one. And now im questioning myself what the fock have I been doing that I didn't watch this before. This is outrageously epic.
I cant get enough of this ceb call is so accurate
I need a friend like ceb.
"Abis nonton TI 9 ke 8 . Kok captain nya LGD pas kalah ga ngerangkul tim nyaa yaa ? pas liquid kuroky sampe nyalahin diri nya sendiri ,karna dia captain ,, lah ini mah boro boro basa basi aja kaga ada LGD .. yaa emang pasti mental down banget udah di comeback gini , tapi ya kita sebagai captain harus mendinginkan suasana setidak nya broo , jangan jdi captain kalo masi mikirin diri sendiri.. 
tapi gtau juga di belakang layar gimana si hehe
#opini"
Ceb is Great coach! How e motivate the team and how he can share positive mindset to enjoy the GAME! That's the only key!!
55:12 notail's heart almost stopped. Damn he skipped a heart beat
"52:56 
JerAx's crying bro."
1 thing ive notice here!!! Jerax! Is always walking and arriving last😂😂😂😂
I Watch this 20+ times i still don't get bored watching this
Topson before chadson
now this makes me wanna play dota
Why am I watching this for like the 7th time now...?
"55:36 fireworks and celebrations for OG, complete silence and stillness from LGD. What a surreal moment."
Im having problems now to much problems and now i watch this to remind myself everything is possible 💓
the one shouting  @24:06 is from the future
"The thing these true sights have shows is that the teams that have fun are better in the long run no matter win or lose.
The falls of Chinese and russian teams kind of prove it.
Teams that do not have that friendship mentality will not excel for long."
i am confused does like every ti final do the teams smoke
Ti 10 is coming and we rewatch it again
Watching it for 8 th time already
Haha the last moment OG win with all those sad face from chinese make me smile everytime watching this
37:55 Pogson
one of my all time favorite videos/movies
i'm cry :(

Im glad that OG win this but somehow i wanna see FY lifting that aegis so sadge man.
"Ti10 is around the corner, it's about time people re-watch Ti8 and Ti9 True Sight again."
LGD LOOKS LIKE VILLAIN IN ANIME SERIES 😂
"Notail: I m trying to get these,someone has to def base
Jerax:ana you wanna relo into the base...?
Memes?
Ana:fuck off
Jerax:bye bye 🤣"
FUCK THAT'S GUESS ALWAYS CORRECT!!! That's real DOTA2 PRO PLAYER in the world
greatest ESPORTS story  ever!
"Ti 8: THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST Ti EVER!!








Also Notail: You should get this pants"
Best TI finals of all time.
The trash talk is so good! Can't have dota without the flame 🔥🔥🔥
"38:48 CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBBB

52:10 Win or Lose,We don't care, We play!

43:09

43:56 lose together slay together"
To this day it still confuse me how notail can play and cast at the same time.......
"Its good to see, People full of ego gets destroyed fucking mentally ang emotionally"
At least in the interview chalice apologize on it because he's the one who make a decision for them where do they go and what will make do..
31:04 Evil laugh jerax hahahaah
Where's the Jerax ES here?
And the next TI Topson prove to everyone he is the best mid player in dota by winning his second TI back 2 back...
Watching this after Ana's comeback
arguably the best  TRUE SIGHT of all time.
Watching this for the 3rd time and this true sight is really the best one.
"2021, still hyped about Topson winning TI on his first try."
"31:00, JerAx laughing at Ceb and N0tail cussing was hilarious xD"
"When I play my very best nothing else would matter. Yohan
Right in the chest man"
"I feel like, ceb's motivational speech and how someone in OG cracks a joke while they are playing was the clutch, while LGD just kept pointing out their teams mistakes. I mean grownups know what they did wrong, someone else pointing out aswell just makes it worse at such situatons. You gotta keep the moral up, not make their moral go even more down"
"Where is the crowd who said "" Go home O.G "" 🎃🎃"
37:54 is the best moment
"I watched this more than 5 times now, and still I get goosebumps."
Props to Ceb. Even when the times went downhill he was just raising their morale. Unlike Psg was just pointing to each other when times went bad. OG fucking deserves this win!
"52:51 other OG's : SCREAMMMMMMM
Ana : wow...."
2:45
"2021 April
And I still don't understand what notail said something about bobleh 12:35"
The best final 👌👍
2021 : never get old this game
"I joined DOTA  in late 2017 and the TI8 happened......since  that day I stopped playing everything else and now I have 1168 hours in Dota(Not much I know) and I enjoyed every single match.
I don't remember if I ever played any other game with this amount of love.
I remember I had to work after watching the Ti8 and I was so pumped up and emotional at the same time but unfortunately none of my friends played Dota except for one and he was not in office that day.

Dota till the day I die."
Watched it for the 15th time. So much respect.
"Topson at 56:10: We won TI, what the fuck!? 
and still won the next one.
Man, what a guy"
11:30 W33 IS IT REALLY YOU?!
53:43 where is the euls dodge?
35:57 chills man chills
What the fuck is that face chinese HAAHHA trush talk more
"49:47  *Game 5 OG losing early game*
OG: ""topias-zeus, ana-ember..."" ""johan-prophet anybody?""  ""johan-prophet, jesse-rubick!"""
Thanks for the true sight
The moment OG won the tournament... the rest was just formality tbh. They all went god mode at this moment
"The way he says ""some minds are really hard to beat"" and the camera pans over fy and Somnus. CHILLS."
"April, 2021 and i still reply this"
i love watching PSG.LGD lose. hahaha! too much confident. -2021

_Congratulations_"
"37:28
Jerax is fucking cool! haha"
"the difference between TI8 and TI9 true sight, TI8 both team are on point about what the other team is doing, TI9 OG completely reads Liquid, Liquid have the sightest idea what is happening"
ohhh the meta of GPM talents...
Somnus tries too fucking hard to look like he's a fun guy around the cameras 😭
uncle roger playin dota 2
"If anything made justice for "" OGs run to claim aegis at ti8 "" it's this true sight ,not giving fuck about anything or anyone , trusting teammates more in do or die situations thats what made og what it is Today ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
Still emotional even though I have watched this a hundred time..
37:54
Go home lgd
this is the best TI Final so far
Go home OG :(
I wondering what music topson play
ONE OF THE BEST VIDEOS EVERY CREATED I LOVE OG NOTAIL
Chalice is the most cocky chinese man ive ever seen.
"Famous last word

""Teams that win game 1 always lose the finals"""
"I swear the last game brings tears to my eyes. The scoring, how OG was so into the game until the Ancient Exploded, Jerax ""It doesn't matter!"" Chills man. It literally showed a team worthy of being Champions."
GO HOME OG PA MGA TANGA AHAHAHAHAHAHA
Came back after Ana got announce...
I wanted to see a 3rd ti finals with the same team og but sadly jared retired
I'm laughing at all the people who where shouting go home og
Wheres the tusk king now??
Rewatching this because ana came back
"mute them, block them for our lose guys :))))))))))))))))))))))))))))"
"Notice the atmosphere difference between the two teams? When LGD fails, the room is silent. But when OG fails, Ceb tries to lift their spirits up. I know this is a game, but I also model my leadership like Ceb. He stepped up whenever his team needs him, trusts the decisions and choices of his team, and reminds them to be humble whenever they are getting ahead. Best dota 2 finals ever! #manilamajors #ogback2back #champions"
THIS IS REAL EMOTIONAL
35:00 music name? please.
It took 14 minutes for Topson to say a word.
"8:30
9:55
14:46
30:56
38:27"
Tu la berlagak sgt.. Haha..
In my book valve still owes us a TI.
Who's here when for Ana's comeback?
Who's here after og announced ana's comeback
the only scene where I saw Ana insisting 'go Ember'
Power of Friendship
Who watched this again after Ana came back at OG? Jeeezzz looking forward to their results!
"Everytime give up with Dota 2, I need to rewatch this game over and over."
Ana is back in his million dollar part time job
I watched this live...THE BEST TI in HISTORY!
Never bored watch this grand final idk why 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
"After 40:16 this video just gets so emotional, from feeling the pain of LGD to the joy Notail found, this video is pure bliss however you look at it. Love this game."
STILL THE BEST INTERNATIONAL OF ALL TIME <3
lol. why delete comments. the chinese players were acting so arrogant. MAKES IT EVEN SWEETER
I watched it again because ANA IS BACK!
"Still, the best TI Championship."
"Dude I don't know what is happening in my heart but when I watch this, I wanna cry ! ! ! ! !"
44:00 ceb together
"idk how many times i've watched this true sight. but all i know is more than 15 times and the Ceb's call is still giving me chills. i think i've comment this video before but i still gonna do it again 😂😂😂. and i still crying watching them every single time. they really deserved it no matter how much they failed in the previous Ti. After fly betrayal, both ana and notail breakdown, im not sure about jerax but Ceb is their core for winning either motivation and game analyzation. Not to forget the Topson's prodigy 😂. I never get bored of this True sight and always motivate me to play dota even if im noob 😒. But yeah, One of best Iconic true story, fairytale, legend and saga of the millennium of all time. Now im being exaggerating :P"
"I always come back to 34:06 to hear that Reckless Chinese Fans shouting ""GO HOME OG"" loudly just to cry later on 54:43 😂😂😂"
What's the song when they win
The way Maybe says Kunkka still gives me the chills. OG may have won but we can't deny the fact that he was the most dominant mid laner that year.
"I dont play dota i used to play league of legends, but damn it, this moment is the most heart chilling moment ive ever watched."
"The Best TI Drama Ever.
-change my mind-"
"They dare picking axe agaisnt tusk king
Few minutes later
Axe to tusk king:hold my ""axe"" king."
"Jerax: ""Ana you wanna relo into the base? Memes? :)""
Ana: _laughing_ ""Fuck off :D"""
35:59 ghoosebombs omg
Dream team OG best of the best.
whats the music at 7:20
"Meu sonho se alguém traduzir essa comunicação pra mim, e perfeito demais pqp😍"
""""" topias god is monkey like "" jhahhahahhahahhaha ceb trippinnnnnn  6:58"
ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
"TI7: greedily holds aegis for like forever
TI8: Share aegis with friends"
tusk king LOOOOL
Китацы наглые поплатились за базар)что если мы не увидим их гг))да да
The moment that they're telling Ceb it was real. Goosebumps everytime
"Actually, at game5, notail was hesitating to pick Zeus for topson. But Ceb let him pick whateva he wanted. that won the game. GGs this ti8 better than any TIs"
This never gets old. I will show this to my son and my grandson
Who's here 2021?
"38:40
chills, literal chills"
Never fails to bring me hype in dota.. love this series so much :)
"Who is that man whom they all high fived 5:20 , he must be the real happy person"
"Everytime I watched this, I always laugh so hard for these arrogant chinese player."
"How I love seeing Somnus getting served, after all the shittalk especially from his side. Arrogance is the first downfall in sport."
Rewatching this I really need some inspiration
i comeback watch this after see jerax live steam
i get goosebumps everytime they win the final game and when they lift the aegis. damn
"Another day for a pants that people think it's jeans, but it's not, it's basically sweat pants."
"7:16 ""remember boys, it's not over until it's over."""
Guys do we know the music in 48:58
"That fireworks behind fy after the final game and his starring at the screen, is otherworldly!! It’s so painful seeing fy heartbroken! :("
No but really... what are those pants that N0tail was talking about? I want them
The team who play for fun and also encouraging each other. The other too much trashtalk and blaming each other.
30:59
And this video will definitely exceed 10 millions view.
nothing has or will come close to this in gaming for a long time honestly.
greatest TI off al time ! respect !!!
playing with Ceb is like having a father in-game.
This O.G team can't win on best of 5 finals against this years E.G    @​
Why china chinese always talking in a toxic way..
""" GO BACK OG ?"" xD"
shit still the best TI
"when ana said...""it doesn't matter"". he already did know the turn out!"
Ana humble G.O.A.T
"Selling 7.5k account for 250E with many arcanas, pm me :Q"
"""Go home"" Who ?"
"'Holy shit Ana, you're so fucking good man"" - when you get praised by the GOAT!"
"BEST TI IN MY LIFE , THANKS OG :3"
"chinese are simple minded, when their teams are winning they shout very loud and they even shout go home og and when their team is losing, their mouths are opening lmao. lgd became arrogant after winning 2 scores and they also said that og are dumb so that's one of the reason why they loss here and now the tables had been turned. serves them right. good thing they loss here and they loss in 2019 and didnt reached the grand final in ti9. cheers for og for their determination"
ugly chalice
"March 31 , 2021 I still watch this lit VIDEO!"
wHeRe Is AxE?
"When they lifted the aegis, they shared to another to lift it, not like TI7 winner who just keep for himself, u know who i mean hahaha"
Might be coming here again in a month or 2. Most enjoyable series.
"So nice to see how this guys stand on the street and people just go, dont see this mans and dont know that they battle for millions"
"Now the Jerax is back playing, it gives me hope that OG is going to be reforged!"
Still watching for 100th time this should be streamed in Netflix
"Почему, сколько не пересматриваешь, каждый раз мурашки"
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB!
"""im in for everything""
""Zeus!"""
absolutely beautiful
"17:30
Notail: alallalaal
Topson: aaaaahahhh"
"27:59 Ceb in Game 4: ""This might be the Axe game."""
The story of OG is what makes this more emotional
31:02 Translate what Ceb is saying please. Haha. Same reaction with JeRax here. lol
Who's watching this right now?
I love how Jerax walks lmao. He's so chill
This is my 5th times
i hit 15000 hours of dota during this finals. Whatever they have i have more than that......persistence can overcome talent
here I am reminding myself in this quarantine to never give up again.
2:45 . Ana being Ana
I watched this true sight at least 20 times and never get bored
"The pure and uncontrolled smile they had on thier face after coming out from game 3😭... 
Ps- i lost count of how many times ive watched this😂"
31:01 can anyone tell what din ceb say here. I think its funny. Haha. Jerax laughed at it.
"Game 1 ANA

"0:42

"Teams that wins Game 1 always lose

"anytime youtube recommends this again, you just have to watch it"
"Me: Topson is so calm
Topson: 37:54 RUUUUUUUUUUN!"
very cringe to the both teams 10:49
"""tusk king"" after end game sadboi hahaha"
"Ohh. Fuck this is really good! I didn't watch it even though it is always on my recommendation, I watched this time  because I miss TI tournament. I'm just hoping this year TI10 will be back and have this heart stopping actions!"
"You can say what you want, but this is the best lineup that dota has ever seen. JerAx was a cheat code, always one step ahead of the enemies."
Ceb is the MVP of this TI!! Damnnnn his confidence and belief in each teammate got them the Aegis! Fucken genius
ana always chill🤟❤️
Very good movie!! It made passion rushed back to me!! Dota forever!!
"great idea to create such film, raw emotions its really great! its like you sitting next to these guys in the cabbins!"
"Notail si so badass smoking next to that ""no smoking"" signage 😎"
Dude the moment the music hits at 54:18 I get chills everytime that score is amazing.
"Everytime I rewatch this video, always making me 'goosebump'"
38:49 ceeeeeeeeb
30:58 - 31:09 my fav scene 🤣🤣
When Ceb says ‘you’re gonna see some shit mate’ after picking the Axe
Sure Ana from time to time watches this video when he misses this incredible times
"im just gonna drop it here.
odpixel is a fucking legend."
"Just remember guys, when you feel down, remember all WISP (IO) game in TI finals wins, 100% win rate"

Yeah. I am here cause I miss the TI.
"""We won TI what the fuck?""

It's the best TI so far
I contributed about 5M views to this by now
"49:45 Ceb: Topson's Zeus and Ana's Ember!
N0tail meekly: Johann's Prophet anybody :'(

I love BigDaddy"
"The lgd had no smile at all, how pity they are"
2021 march 17
@31:45 notail - poooo taaaaah whahahaha
5:40 the sumiya?
Maybe all those hours playing the game was worth the willpower I got from this video.
"i trust your fvking ember!

(Fist bump)"
Best TI ever!!
"The puffy feeling eventually taste because game unfortunately cry pro a vacuous desert. enthusiastic, fragile hall"
"Ah yes, my favorite anime season"
they must of edited the audio in cause the chinese crowd was definitely not cheering like that.
i GENUINELY get goosebumps every time i watch this. especially CEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBBBB!
"Comparing to Liquid in TI9, LGD is much more mentally stable, focused and respecting to the opponent. Really two equal teams, mental game more than Dota game."
jerax anyone ??
@54:45 my girlfriend so sad
cant believe these pros dont know some heroes lol
Ti10 china vs europe again the el classico doto
ODpixel 👏
22:10
March 14 2021. Still watching.
"OG will not be appreciated if it's not as top tier as PSG LGD. They're both Champions they both work as hard as the other, sacrificing weekends and sleep just to be the best. They both display the highest level of gaming in history. I love both team specially OG, Jerax and Fy is my fave though.. 100 years later and still be remembered. Or 1000 years later my great grandchildren will be watching this up in space."
"LGD fans:Go home OG!
OG inside their capsule:They are going home bois!"
The next memories legend👍
OG from roster ripped apart by anime level betrayal to becoming Dota Legends.
55:40 is a mood
"Nobody:

Me when im not with my girl:

41:48"
59:43 who took jerax' bottle?
Somnus saying`spectre is so badass` ana spectre 10:16
"There's a lot of people still saying TI3 is still the best because they changed the meta but we're not only talking about the game here, it's the story behind it. TI8 is so fucking wholesome. Even non-dota players can be motivated and be inspired by the story of OG from TI8."
"“Give the boy his invoker” “If you feel like rubick, we’ll go for rubick, yeah?” Topson’s first invo was in bad play but they still trusted him with the second. Mad respect for this team, they put trust rather than contradicting it.

edit: wow this blew up, came back here to get my yearly motivation. Thank you valve, OG and all the teams and staffs behind the Ti that made DotA fun to watch, and to play. 🫶"
This is beautiful I love OG ❤️
10:28 i like this part
"Notail's emotions are the best, oh fuck I'm crying..."
54:31 is this too much to ask for 🥺
"If the translations were accurate, then i think lgd coach, chalice, somnus and a bit of fy were being so cocky and over confident in this series. Especially lgd coach and chalice and these ch crowd is so disrespectful and that caused them."
"I'm a Diehard Miracle fan, but rewatching this everytime im feeling down just raises my spirits up. That play by Ceb with Axe makes me cry everytime"
"55:14
TI8 culminated in N0tail’s expression."
"Me: Ana is a good pro player. Such a great carry player.

Ana: I cant even see my own hero."
I genuinely feel sorry for LGD. They looked good and their chemistry was also good. Not like Liquid in TI9 where you can see they don't agree with stuff and gets mad instantly.
12:28 Someone tell me please how do you write what it says in French?
What is the soundtrack at the end of the video?
Where are the OG fanfrogs that are back to watching true sight because they didn't qualify to the major? LUL
which game OG comeback with ana spec and topson arc warden ?
"2021 still watching it, I think I've seen this for 10 times already and dude it fucking still affect me emotionally. Notail really deserve ti8! Love ya guys!
#DreamOG"
Can someone who speaks French tell me word for word what Ceb says in French @31:00???
My like reached the 145k . I like to watch this video as a  source of motivation in the middle of distress.
That ember.. Just wow.
38:45 cebbbbbbbb
"55:38 i remembered that meme with the dog in a burning house saying ""this is fine"""
"og is so fucking emotional

love and friendship bring og to ti win 2018
Chinese too arogant thats why
It's 2021 but I'm still watching this ti ..
"Yes many ppl give more attention to ana and topson or the captain/leader notail and ceb. But for me, jerax is by far the best player in OG. So for this final, its like im watching the battle between jerax vs fy (for me at least)."
TAKABUR GAMING IS REAL
who came here after OG didnt get wild card slot?
"MY PTSD IS COMMING WHEN I WACTH TI8 TRUE SIGHT , CANN'T BELIEVE  LGD  LOST THE GAME,FUKING AME"

Things might have gone a whole different direction if that Ember pick didn't come out for Game 5. Damn, even today Game 4 and 5 give me the chills."

"17:41  n0tail smoking on  Non-Smoking area, how badass"

Truly a magical story."

"""OG is best when coming back from behind"" ... lol this couldnt be more wrong for the current OG ... they couldnt play from behind if their life depends on it"
noob china GGEZ lol
I just realized that you can hear DotA Archive's intro music in 3:28
I want beef. I watch this
I REWATCH THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE THE DRAMA. BTW THE BIG FAT STAFF FROM LGD WAS A JINX
39:16 that's what I always see every game I play
55:48 the guy at the back wanted to smile and celebrate but he is inside LGD's booth. hahahaha
Waiting for TI 10 be like 🙄
6:32 gets funnier everytime i hear it 😂😂😂
Watching 2021
TI8 was easily the best TI. Then TI9 is second best. Just unreal.
Warms my heart anytime I see somnus and his brother. Really is his emotional crutch
Ceb the god of focus 🤣
I don't play this game but damn OG's teamwork. They look so OP.
41:49 Ceb's inner French spirit getting ignited
55:14 Notail face. i will never forget that face. A face where u know u will get the thing u crave for years.
topson first tournament is ti and won. literally
HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAH WATCHING THIS IN 2021 YET LGD LOST
"55:32 ""Ceb, it's real"" just hits different"
TRUE SIGHT MARATHON BOYS
This is why MOBILE LEGENDS cannot compete with the level of hype that dota brings
35:55 - PL problem
"That moment was the most genuine of winning spirit moment in DOTA history,,i keep tearing when watching this doc,,"
My pandemic therapy
"China fans : Go home OG
OG : Ok *(take the aegis home)*"
"""What are they doing? Feeding? I'm going in.""

Famous last words."
'We won TI WTF' 💀💀💀
still one of the most beautiful story ever told.
Friendship is the strongest strategy in sports
Is it just me or it sounds like Interstellar soundtrack when OG is winning the game 5.
did topson get a plastic surgery?
https://youtu.be/xcu9hzbDr38
I came back to watch this and 2019. I love how OG is about lifting each other up instead of shit talking the enemy team. OG respects those they play against. It's the same in 2019. They make other teams look like children with their sportsmanship and their positive attitudes.
"""Johan prophet, anybody?"", cracks me up."
"""mute them"", but literally watch every movement of OG in real life. im dead lol"
Till today you can feel the emotion of the whole OG tean after winning
"46:02 When everybody is trying to gank you, and you don't know what to pick anymore"
still mad about how chalice is running his worthless mouth.
I've watched this like 10 times
"""We won TI, what the fuck!?"" Man, I love Topson."
"The only quote that i always remembering when i play Dota

 ""Win or lose, we don't care, just play"" -Ceb

But of course youll need to do your best in order to achieve success! Anyway whos watching right now because you'll miss JerAx and Ana playing in TI and in OG."
On est sur les nerfs
valve can we get a tf2 TI now please
LDG was negative team....got beated😂😂😂😂😂hahahah
31:01
Jerax ♥♥♥
2021 GAMERS WYA!!!!
"Ana: ""it's doesn't matter""
The moment he turns on GOD mode.
23:54"
11:21 LOL man
"That's what i need to hear when our team goin to lost the aegis , man up boiss , win or lose we dont care we play .#feebadforfygodtho #missingtheoldogandlgdlineup"
Ceb carried this Team fxcking hard ✊
i've never played a second of DOTA but this gives me more goosebumps than any high budget hollywood movie ever
"""Did you know that the fluke is the most common fish in the sea?""
Hahaha"
It's not over till it's over.. Thanks dota thanks Og 😊🤗
"That moment when ceb its ok ""ill destroy them"" and he did with the axe"
we won the ti wtf
"JerAx is game 5's MVP. Before they won that rosh fight, Notail wanted to back, Jerax said: ""FUCKING MAN UP"" and made the right call. Then, the one at the end as well, Ceb's worried about ES' echo, but Jerax said ""It doesn't matter, FUCKING END THE GAME."" This guy's the reason I play Pos4."
rewatching one of the best series in dota. Damn i miss watching TI
55:36 Chinese New Year
55:36 dokter tirta cipeng main dota
38:23 those people with all their mouth opened 😂
"24:07
Fan: you got this, the next one and then the next one...
This guy literally predicted og winning game 4 & 5"
55:36
55:37 Happy Chinese New Year! 🎉
"I'm not a fan of china, but that fy guy chill , I like that, he's a great teammate"
"56:13 that should be anyone's reaction after joing just one tournament, it being TI and winning it."
11:30 hello w33haa
Well this just proves that overconfidence and pride are  dangerous things
Props to both team for entertain us
Feel like a movie
i start watching this every day true sight idk why brain choose to maybe bc this is so entertaining for me to keep playing
"The real OG moment right there on that specific year. Its been 2 years now , still feels great watching this."
These chinese are so confident. They went home without the aegis.
"Skillwise, OG was weaker than LGD.
On ti8 LGD were just on another level of skill and understanding of the game. They were exceptionally good in nearly every aspect of this patch. They were the first one to completely destroy the broken alchemist at the time, and the personal skill of every player was just insane. However, the raw-talent and pure skill is not everything that takes from you to win the game, OG were stronger mentally, they had nothing to lose. Yes, OG played worse than LGD overall, but when it truly matters OG didn't falter. LGD had those expectations that made them weaker in the most deciding moments. You can see, when OG counterplay them - how much does LGD players talk out of frustration compared to OG, when OG are losing, they don't allow themselves to get distracted out of the frustration, they kept focus. In this I wanted to point out Topson, as he had the roughest time of them all - he has been quite frequently dumpstered on mid by Maybe, but even in the most shit game, Topson kept his focus and continued playing the game unbothered with all he got(and left from destroyed mid xd). But to be honest, it's not really fair to point praise a single person from OG, they all were insanely good in their attitude and focus. 

This is kinda reminding me of One Piece's Luffy vs. Katakuri, when Katakuri was stronger, had superior fruit, had stronger haki, was just physically stronger in every aspect compared to Luffy, but Luffy still managed to take him out despite of all of the factors."
"Game 4 always gives me goosebumps.
Most of the Crowd: GO HOME OG!
Then OG wins the game. Damn it felt good watching it."
"жаль что в финале нет плохих парней которых было бы не жалко, проиграли бы ог я бы был в пичале, но проиграли лгд и как то на душе еще больнее особенно fy который сдерживает боль"
Fy deserves more❣️
"""15000 hours of DOTA, whateve  they have, I have more than them "" :) Still gives me the chill everytime"
I have already watched it 5 times
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaxPgiSAZUKdwJyQbi7yKKQ
OG makes me feel like I can do the impossible. Like everything I've done to get this far in life actually adds up no matter what the result is. I'm tearing up just typing those two sentences.
Ana u motivated me to play dota
DotA 2 craziest game and comeback is goosebumps sick mental game.
I miss TI so bad
"I always come back to watch this again and a again, and a again."
The moment that you all looking for 38:36
i came here again and that one in TI9 cuz documentaries in netflix suck major ass
You say invoker like pig like that hero is so fuck but you eat the animal. Hahahahaha serve you right not win this tournament. Shame.

Whenever I need motivation I come to watch OGs miraculous run
Never gets old. Damn
"Can't get tired of watching this TI episode. ""CEEEEEEEEEEEEEBBB!"" still give me chills"
February 2021 still watching og slay slay and slay
He jinxed it
I've never played Dota. But I'ce seen this for like 10 times and always so captivating and magical. #DreamOG
that guy from lgd totally jinxed it
"Just realized. If they didn't ban Centaur, they would've won lol."
I know its not the first time you all are watching this.
"jerax, ana like a keygrasm shit"
goose bumps
coming back for my monthly dose of inspiration :D. Miss Ana and Jerax heaps. Best dota 5 man ever created.
I have lose match for whole day this video make me motivate so i open another match then i feed again
"It's 2021 now, I watched this for countless times and it is still giving me the same feels... unbelievable series. OG the best!"
Ну и хуйню мы надрафтили
"32:54 
Ain’t this a chat wheel sound"
"Coming from fy, he really work hard for his team, he's ES got undefeated in the previous games but he got first lost in the grind final, still well played for him"
"N0tail he really deserves to win ti8, he loose his one and only friend ""fly"" but he never leaves OG, they've done it so well"
JerAx  best p4 ever
"serve LGD right no matter how many times i watched this back. Cocky, arrogant & overconfident from the start. but i do feel bad for xNova tho. He's the most humble player in whole LGD."
masterpiece
"Feb 2, 2021 still the best series of all time"
"Feb 2, 2021 still the best series of all time"
"its such an amazing run, such an amazing series, but, such an amazing team, i watch this final over and over again, and it just feels great, everytime, thanks to everyone who loves this game, only love, can make such beautiful things happen."
28:14 famous last words
it is soooooooooo good to see cainis get destroyed
"It's already 2021 and still I'm here rewatching this Greatest TI of all time.
Who's here with me!!!??"
Best ti
Topson celebrating always gives me the chills. EVERY DANG TIME
"LGD: ""PL 25 GUYS""
Also LGD: ""Why do I hear boss music?"""
38:46 it is
"29:50

I can definitely wife that"
Game 5 are you ready? N0tail: 41:29
"One day our country will recognise in Ti ,as a Champion🇵🇭🇵🇭"
"Ti8 i feel sad for topson ,as underdog cameraman didn't recognise him 😟"
"Og ban tiny....

Somnus: Holy crap, ceb is holding a bunch of papers.... 🤣🤣🤣"
Psd lgd lacked love between themselves. Og was full of love and respect for each other. So they won.
Rewatching this after knowing their story feels so refreshing.
2021
"china thinks ""Go home OG"" but actually the opposite"
dah kalah berderai air mata
"the three spirit has been completed Sumail, Jerax, and Ana"
This movie is better than Endgame
"55:36 The booth guy on the left. 

*Woo* firework *pew pew*"
"30:50 that was the saddest ""Oh fuck"", I've ever heard in my entire lifetime."
"PSG.LGD lost the series not because they lack in skills or anything else but because of their huge fat ""EGO""! It's good to be confident but over confidence can be very dangerous."
I never thought NOtail could speak chinese too @17:30 LoL!
Ceb Talk no Jutsu at it's finest💪
I have played this game for over 9000 hours in my life and it's been 10 months since my last game of dota and i still comeback here to watch this masterpiece and the rest of true sight episodes what a great game indeed.
Im here 2021 still has the same feeling watching this all over again
ceeeeeeeeeeeeb) that's actual now)
video give me somuch . thank
"Do they pronounce the names of the heroes in Chinese differently?  I was really surprised to read in the subtitle that they talk about some hero, but it seems to me, they didn't mention it."
2021 and I’m still stuck in 2018 Tea eye. Never have I gone through all the emotions in 1 hour. God bless this video!
"still watching, got chills , Im fucking inspired I want to be a pro player."
On a 6 losing streak. Where does that take me? Back to this.
I fees bad for FY
Big troubles in little China. kkkkk
"10:13 is that saksa?

That shoulder rub on notail is because of cr1t’s bump right? 👀
I cry so much whenever I watch this
VIVA LA PERÚ CTM RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Goodgame❤️
38:39 Fantastic Axe and Where to find him.

I watch this more then 15 times. But still i got goosebumps
"59:41 all I think is ""covid, covid, covid, covid..."""

Fuckin Ana just wanna shake hands and go home LOL
"DOTA=DRUGS.
DONT DO DOTA STAY AWAY FROM DOTA. IT BREAKS PEOPLE LIFE!! AND FOR WHAT?"
This is the reason why I played Dota... My friend recommended this Ti to me... And yeah.. i am now a dota Player.. still noob though😂.... Best game ive ever played....
56:09 BEST PART !!!
"Those of you that are having a hard time especially during this pandemic, stay strong. This video proves the impossible. Reminding myself too."
""" how dare they pick axe on tusk king ? '' pfttt"
Its wanting to feel moments like these or actually feeling moments like these that makes you think that the world isnt so bad
"i miss 'em, so I'm coming back here"
Lgd talks about strat and og talks about enoying game
N0tail takes care of ana so much. He is really big daddy
Before tournament begins they laughed at topson
Feels like a movie
white > yellow
"The deep dedication whitely own because paul monthly seal around a normal swing. fast, smiling t-shirt"
ngl i come back to watch ti8 and ti9 every week... been 4 months
The pyrotechnics going off in the background while plg sits in silence lmao
Notail's face at 55:13 always makes me choke up a little
"Respect Somnus, kinda proud but super player."
Китайцы простенькие бе преувеличений!)
TOPSON : run !
49:50 lol johan so sad
Looking for CEEEEB? 38:48
why don't they translate the french slurs? it's so good! 30:59
overconfident early game .. and see what happen next .. did i wrong but i heard GO HOME OG on game 3 .. 😂😂😂
Kunkka with confidence
Damn. This video editing are fking dope. Its like watching movie. Goosebumps when OG wins. Congrats OG! #GGWP
"I hit 15,000 hours during this finals, whatever they have, I have more than them -n0tail"
"Fate is an interesting thing. Irony is unpredictable and ruthless. One could say that PSG deserved that. I especially like how they called OG the ""turtle team"", yet they were the ones to lose, just like in the tale of a hare and a turtle."
Somnus crying?
Cool t. I ever
"Do you notice, for the final match the entire music changes, it's just way lighter and optimistic, like the editing is bloody perfect, as we already know the ending, but the upliftment of it, the way jerax says at the end it really doesn't matter we have buyback, when his other teammate are a bit cautious, the pause and sharp intake of breath notail takes at the last moment, just when he realises the throne will break and he will finally win TI, everything in the last 15 mins are perfect, they played hero's they were comfortable with, they played hero's they believed in, even when it shouldn't have worked, the way ceb says we have better late game cuz we are better, that faith in eachother, is just truly beautiful"
7:23 i love the beat man!
2021? Still gives me goosebumps
"54:45 the disappointment, the sadness, can be seen through the fans expression"
it's so sad that there is no true sight 2020
I actually like LGD's sense of humour.... Lol
Lol somnus was so camera conscious he made a very awkward interaction/handshake/talk with the guy at 3:06 hahaha
Always great to Watch these but its something special with this one:)
SHOW SOME LOVE👍🔔🤗
Ceb : oppa oppa boysssss
This game was my motivation to pass the board exam in 2018 🔥
2021 im already  watching it again HAHAHHAA
Wait the throne explode
Still the best ti finals ever!!!
NOBODY SEEMS ANA? KKKK WATCHING A PAST MATCH KK 2:44
This video is fucking amazing!
Tusk King? Noob. Too overconfident bro..
i dont even play dota but im entertained!
28:08 he lived to it

Yow FYs shaker is so scary
"The halting home markedly pick because flax gully hang opposite a icky monday. faded, accessible acknowledgment"
"The cultured poet parallely fail because paint jointly analyse including a aberrant cough. sweltering, curved card"
Its 2021 bois!
FY vs JERAX battle of master roamers
2021 boisss
I’ve never once watch any YouTube videos from start to end even just a 5-minute long video. True sight TI8&9 is the only ones that I watched from 0 sec til the end without skipping a single second. Respect. From head to toe.
I've rewatched this many times in the years since. I fully believe Jerax and his plays on rubick is the reason they won this game.
31:44 PEENOISE BE LIKE
Y is no one talking bout Ame..? No glimpse of him lmaoo...4v5 show
"¿Han pasado dos putos años y no pueden poner un subtítulo en español, valve de mierda?"

JOKER IS REAL by TOPSOn
"I respect the Chinese team, but the Chinese crowd? I feed on their sorrow. Classless crowd. Starting from 54:30"
55:37 me every 1 January
"ceb is one hell of a motivator wtf......

Mindset won that last game...."
14:45 KUNKAaaah 💯
2021 and still watching
"We were on a beach trip, and this finals was on our last night there and all we had was a shitty like 10 inch chromebook. Also most of our friends there didn't even know how how the game works, most who did where guys who already stopped playing it, but me and my friend where like it doesn't matter we are gonna watch the TI finals tonight, after that we can party all night long (we didn't know yet what are we in for :) ). So i mind you this was the 6th night of all in tryhard drinking and partying so people where already kinda tired. So around 10 of us sat down in front of a screen so little we barely could see and you can imagine the internet there wouldn't allow us to watch it in a 1060p resolution, so it kinda resembled those old tales where families gathered together to a little shitty radio or tv to watch the football matches, but it was all worth it. In the end most of the people felt too tired so they had to go to sleep, so i was watching the finals with a guy who had little to no idea what was going on (he had like 150 h of dota) and a girl who didn't know shit about the game, so i kept explaining the main things what was happening, but everyone there felt that something magnificent was going on. I can still clearly remember the hype of that axe call or that last 20 of them hitting the throne we all jumped up in the end with goosebumps all over. After we realized that it was like almost 6 o'clock we just went straight to the beach swim into the sea and watched the sunrise."
"Gaddamn,im not into commenting on vids here in youtube but man, i swear to god ive watched this whole documentary about OG and evey single gad damn time, it always give me goosebump."
Still watching this after 2 years
"LGD sounds so cocky now looking back. Lesson learned, even if you're the favorites you can still lose😂"
14:46
someone knows what music is playing in the background in the minute 34:55

2:46 ana : i wont show you my secret before match
38:38 Still gives me goosebumps goddamn
37:11 Topson made game losing mistake here by giving alacrity to the real PL.
Since PSG.LGD lost this TI China started creating coronavirus
ana is underrated
"0:45 Notail saying It's easy to break people's mind, some minds are difficult to break and PSG.LGD team appears that was an epic"
Still here in 2021 and waiting TI 10....
"28:08 ""You're gonna see some shit, man.""


And we did."
59:43 someone stole his bottle ? :D

"In my opinion, Jerax deserved it more than others cause of his individual gameplay, but Ceb make a lot of motivation for team. His mentality is unbelieveble"
"CHINESE FANS : ""GO HOME OG""

OG: "" I WILL GO HOME WITH FCKING AEGIS""

CHINESE : "" oh.."""

The most epic encounter ever I've seen in my life.
"Go home OG?

I m just here for Ceb's epic comeback
The only TI winning team that got me so riled up choosing who the MVP is cause all of them did so good individually and as a team... LEGENDS
still the best esports tournament run of the century.
9:58 is that messi behind notail ??:D??
Miss TI so much. Fuck covid 19
"“If I played my very best, Nothing else would matter” this inspires me to play my heart out in every game every time I hear it ."
Watching Christmas vacation

Seeing chinese crowd to finally shut the fuck up and chinese player crying are one of the satisfying thing ever.
"It's like to watch a film, a good film"
This is my dream
35:41 My dude was living in 2020 already
I miss TI
Great Motivational Video forever
"I like when the subtitle say ""fucking hell"" but the actual LGD cursing is ""fk your mom pussy"" lol"
I'm so glad i have to witness this beautiful moment
"56:10 ""WTF WE WON TI!! FEW MONTHS AGO WE'RE UNKNOWN PLAYING PUBS!!!!!"
28:07 HOW DOES HE PREDICT SOME SHIT!?!?!
"LGD TEAM, Too much confidence
OG TEAM,  Too Cool"

This video are soo good.can you give viva?
Is that Zai on the left side @ 11:33
I'm gonna watch it for the last time. This year.
"pls, nerf the banana"
TI 8 is the best TI. There is so much history. There is a story to tell. It is definitely one of the most important tournament not only in dota but while of esports.
0:22 my love video :X.
Still love the cheerful spirit of Ceb in this series.
"Somnus: - Koohnka
Kunkka: - Kunkka is my name."
Every time I ask myself why I have 2k+ hours in this game I watch this. It’s beautiful.
56:10 Topson XDDDDD
"""SOME MINDS ARE REALLY HARD TO BEAT THOUGH"" -- N0tail"
Amazing stuff. Still.
Commies got it handed to 'eeeeeeem
"OG and LGD team when mess up : It's okay man we got this don't give up !!
Meanwhile on VP : CYKA BLYAT on every single his team mate"
30:55 pls translate what ceb said
"The beautiful offer hemodynamically file because turkey spectacularly pinch near a utopian aries. inexpensive, awesome plier"
"psg is frence right 
so ceb is french too
so basically french revolution ahahah"
Superb.
Am I the only one hoping Netflix would cover True Sight or make documentaries on Dota 2? That would be lit AF it were to happen.
Sumpah terharu
FY is so unpredictable
"42:27 Second of all, whatever they think is fucking bullshit"
55:36 firework
38:40 is my favorite part
videogames make you stupid
Dude imagine how awkward it is walking in the same hallway after beating your enemy
"Man, OG is LEGENDARY."
15th time
"28:06 ""you are gonna see some sh*t man"" CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB"
OD PIXEL THE MVP
Ceb's mentatlity gave og the win.
"Until this day, PSG LGD is not taking off their jackets 😂"
this dog LGD HAHA. noob somnous
"I just jump out from League to Dota 2 and I have never felt this intense in a game competition before. Freaking amazing!!! Would love to watch this again. Felt the chills man , their comebacks are fucking unbelievable.  😍😍😍"
"Dota 2: Pro team use swear words in a documentary it's ok and puts it on the video.  Other Esports. THATS A $15,000 fine!"
"Imagine throwing the last game of TI. 
That mus be so painful."
18:20????
at 18:20 LGD taking pills?
0:22 my love video :X.
2020 and still gives goosebumps
Ceb Carried Topson So fkn hard
"55:13 feel the way n0tail take a deep breath while hitting the throne, somehow i feel it"
"17:39

No one: No Smoking Sign!
No Tail: Call be *BigDaddy*"
The poor doggie had to suffer and watch dis XD.
8:50 this is how i stay when idc about the game lol
it seriously is amazing watching this team. OG is just a group of friends who trust eachother and love to play dota. That's how you make a good team.
50:45 even that guys was shocked!
39:16
Tbh the emotions Topias showed in the last match of the TI8 finals were more than than the whole TI9 finals
"52:10""Guys win or lose, we dont care, we play!"""
This win is crazy coz og just make a new team in just 3 months left before ti. And topson is just a normal pub player before this ti and ceb found topson on pub when topson outplayed him and ceb is a coach not a player. And notail emotion coz his friend leave og
This might be one of the best game for this century
Superb.
"This is the historical moment for OG.Its From a crumble team into a fcking strong team.They believe each other,have each other back.The strong bond to win.✌️"
"no matter how many times ill watch this. Jerax face when he says "" wanna relo in? ""MEMES?"" with that shit eating grin. xD i die irl"
"Even if Sasufly betrayed Narutail, Shikacebstian always there for him"
"LGD is indeed Good. All of their games they stomp OG, but somehow OG mastered the art of comeback. It's not even a fluke. OG defeated LGD twice"
I hate somnus
55:37 legend says he still looks away from the fireworks
They keep losing due to that Rosh battle
somnus and fy's devastated faces at the end of game 5...  still moved me to tears until now
Huhuhuhu still an epic win! Omg omg omg
We need a man like Ceb in our team
"LGD said ""Team that win game 1 always lose the finals"" but OG prove it that they win Ti8"
31:00 what did he say? Can someone tell me what language is that?
"It's All About The Teamwork, The Commitment & Consistency GG OG GG!."
"Man that look on Notail's face when they're hitting the throne on game 5. A hint of excitement, of sadness of happiness."
"right now it is at 8,748,803 views. now, we wait ."
"poor LGD lose at their hometown , they give a good game,,nice game,"
TOPIAS !!!
Poor dog I liked my own commet how sad.
2018 ti final > 2019 ti final
Omg.
Like si veniste a jalartela.
ana Ember is amazing!
When can i watch topson first play with og
"Just imagine there is an alien planet 
And there are dota heroes as aliens 
And every year they came to earth and give super powers to 5 selected humans to become heroes they want 
And every year we have to fight for the fate of existence of earth"
"i am seriously watching this before my driving exams to get myself in the right mindset!! I'm ready to win, im ready to lose! if they smash us we smash them back!!! - CEB I""M READY!"
fuck u china
My guy at 11:28 stressed af he INHALED that shit lmao
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
Roses are red violets are blue if you give a like God will forgive you 0:22xx.
Ya Allah ampunilah dosa kami semua yang setuju like.
"52:08 ""MAN UP! MAN UP!"""
1:02c.
Still watching this to see notail's facial expression before winning TI
ya allah plz forgive me  stop watching this.
Felt bad for the chinese but notail needed this
"Still watching this gem, best TI ever"
"Being an ex Liquid , Jerax game sense is so good ......when he says to start a fight its likely to go in his favor"
Can anybody tell me what Ceb says on 31:02
If Ceb says they are gonna win then they will win
Very nice….
The poor doggie had to suffer and watch dis XD.
if you want God to forgive you dont commet here just go to the church and pray.
You can clearly see which team mentality soaked up SEA
1:02c.
"The difference in mentality between OG and LGD is really astounding. OG says one or two words about the last game but then forgets about it. What's done is done. Instead, they try to recollect their thoughts. LGD just looks back at their mistakes and what could have been, not looking into the future."
Best dota game in the history of dota. Ez
All dislikes are PSG LGD FANS
"how many times you watched this without skipping
Me:Yes"
Superb.
China #2
I love u girl
Ingat....  Ada allah....

"When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable."
They lose the moment Ceb's axe do the thing. Should've pay more attention.
Is my is my mother goose club out.
Yang sayang aku like yang cinta allah coment.
Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh.
Jerax literally a meme guy even in 2019 ti. 🤣😂🤣😂
"LGD played great, but OG were just godlike. The individual plays and the decision making separates them from the other teams."
I love this movie.
Yang pilih allah like.
Perfect.
Very nice….
"The brash shingle dewailly shave because gram proportionately wreck on a lively copyright. abashed,  foamy guarantee"
Wow.
I HATE CHINA
"One thing I love about this OG rooster is..even they lost the game..they don't even think how they lost the game,who's fault why we losed but instead ceb gives them motivation for the next game... that's the true spirit in team games.."
I love u girl
beautifull
Hmm i only played dota 1 i think they have different meta base on their country.
Yang milih allah like 40000 ya.
if you want God to forgive you dont commet here just go to the church and pray.

Music combined with best TI story ever is pure emotion.
0:33x.
Yang pilih Allah like yang pilih Dajjal abaikan.

I can't stand merlini in this series. He was so biased towards LGD. Thank god OG win.
Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh.
"""Go home OG"" yeah they got home with that aegis."
Superb.
"6:33 ""holy crap, ceb is holding a bunch of papers""
Later in ti9 og vs lgd
Notail is holding more papers"
Maaf ya allah hamba liat ini.
"Dunno why...the background music kinda reminds me of interstellar.
Watching it always gives me goosebumps and emotions. How I wish I could've watched it live physically. Would've been realllllly hype"
"china language oh this video just make it better, LGD like a true villain, and og was like the main actor, kinda look like a movie, the feel they give from the music component and some beautiful shoot, oh god.... i do really like it so much."
42:45 classic n0tail. It was a great fckin TI man. Just having a #throwbackthursday
Superb.
Youtube really knows how to give you result of good movie. If you search Movies in 2018. You'll see this.
"56:57  - Man this shot, NoTail doesn't even want to show the crowd the aegis his is so in love with the fact that he won after all hurdles."
"52:51 remember this, faker defeat"
"PSG.LGD says * Teams that win game 1 always lose the finals
- In the end They Fucked Up HAHAHAH/ 2020 HERE"
Oppa Oppa Boys
"i feel bad for LGD's coach when he said. winner lost 1st round, and they did. after game 5."
"Who's still watching this?

It's so funny how OG crashes Chinese hopes! AHAHAHAHAHAHA"
It has been 2 years and this was one of  the most inportant moments in gaming history
truly the best documentary of all time
u cant motivate 2k mmr players with that movie.
Man that Ceb play never gets old. Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb!!
Bi
Ya Allah ampunilah dosa kami semua yang setuju like.
One thing that made lgd lose is they easily affected by lose. They easily get discourage unlike OG. They motivate eachother when they lose.
This is actually really well produced and the commentators just give it that edge haha
"2 years past, same chills 🌻💛"
Trash crowd
"55:38 it's Christmas time again boiiis, this with corona virus."
Can't get enough after watching another series of True Sight. FUCKING EMOTIONAL!

"Jesse is the MVP, Stole the Global Silence to Silence all Chinese Crowd lul"

"Ana: I can't even see my hero xD

Jerax 's game sense is so sharp. Excellent
"“So how many times have you watch this?”

Still gives me chills in 2020
"“So how many times have you watch this?” 

Me: Yes

Edit: WOW! Almost 1k likes! Thanks you so much! Cheers lads :D"
"the only thing that LGD is good at is by prediction, that OG is good at comeback, well its a 2-1 standing and LGD lost championship. :D"
was this the best TI final ever or what?
"If there is a better video on Youtube, im yet to find it"
@29:50 what a beaut
"FY: They dare to pick Axe in front of the Tusk king?
Ceb: Yes!"
Was clapping unconsciously! :')
"Me and my son chilling at the table in 2040.
My Son watching his fave eSport: YOOOO!! What a sick comeback...
Me: pfff it was alright.
My Son: What do you know about comebacks Dad?
Me: Let me tell you about the story of OG..."

"La mejor final de todas para mi, muy emotivo."
I don't like Chinese team .. they are so boring
Someday i will watch TI live to catch this historical moment
Watching this 7 times. Still emotional and goose-bump as the first time.
"*""Guys, Win or Lose we don't care we* *play.""*
That's next level to calm your nerves."
can someone exlplain this 45:13 ? im noob if its about draft...if TB 3rd pick its useless..why? pls i no idea
I wish FY wins a TI. I still do.
"36:52
Ceb's Primal Fury."
Rewatching all these true sight cause we dont uave a TI10. :(
Aaaaa back when everybody bullies Topson...😬
November 2020 anyone?
idk why but I think OG's mentality is way more better than LGD's mentality and I think that's what won them this championship.
CHINA HAS THE WORST CROWD!
"That ""Ceeeeeeeeeeeb"" shout casting still give chills bruuh.."

"Watch over and over again stiil get the hype !! What a series both 2 teams.

The cracking voice of Notail saying to Ceb that they won. You gonna feel that they really had those hard years.
"LITERALLY THE BEST ""PINASARAP LANG GUSTO PA MANALO!!!!"""

THE ANIMATION OF THE AXE CALL STILL GIVES ME CHILLSSSSSSSSSS
"at 55:20 shows you all the difference, can't say for certain but if LGD had won i doubt they would've hugged/celebrated together as friends the way OG did"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPzja4HAmDc&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=Dota_Fun_From_Brisan
what is the name of the tool held by the notail . 6:36 - 6:39

QQQ (Lgd coach): When Roshan was up, none of you guys wasn't even there"
14:45 the most punchable face in the world 💩 💩
I dont remember how many times ive watched this. Still good. Over 9000/10
Best anime ever :( i cried
"52:15 omg. I dont want to say this, but can you please tell her."
"TI8: Is this guy topson even for real?
TI9: destroys every midlaner"
56:01 That is some Interstellar + Red Bull level music.
"FUCK YES DUDE! You know what really carried this game? Ceb's morale. PSG was being all cocky and serious, while Ceb managed to keep OG in a fun, calm mood.

They were losing so fucking hard the last match, yet Ceb still managed to tell his teammates to keep their head high and morale higher.

If you didn't at least ""get something in your eye"" from watching this, what the fuck is wrong with you?"
17:50    i feel so so bad for ame he's so great carry but he still humble even they are winning !
Ive watched this literally 9times
42:00 music?
"Очень много эмоций) 
Мурашки после включения были практически каждые тридцать секунд. Великолепная операторская, режиссёрская, да и вообще, командная работа была проделана над фильмом. 
Но наверное самый яркий для меня был момент, это контраст, когда в тот миг, пока OG смакуют свою победу, китайцы из PSG.LGD вынуждены быть попросту забытыми и покинуть арену. Они сыграли достойную серию, дошли до финала The International и заняли второе место - достижение, которое достигли лишь с десяток команд за всю историю соревновательной Dota 2, но это всё равно лишь второе место... 
Одновременно и радуешься за OG, и понимаешь, как сейчас больно каждому из пятёрки LGD. 
Потрясающий фильм)"
"Maybe it’s just me but I honestly still think Chen needs a rework. So many pros pick him in part to show off ability to play a difficult hero, but mostly for the global mek. It costs so many games with little reward."
this run is one of the most magical runs of all time in ESports. imagine that year they experienced their lows of lows and highs of highs
Kid face topias
Someone knows where i can find music from this film?
"Don't know how many times I've watch this true sight and still getting goosebumps when Ceb said ""this is my game boys"""
Hochmut kommt vor dem Fall.
"Everytime OG won a fight, they hype themselves, they shout, they scream, always thinking positive. They really deserve to be a champion."
"LGD “ im having headache from playing “ 
Ceb- i want to play ! I want to play play dota!!"
25:19 so is he still wearing the jacket?
They trash talk and then the lose and cry. Absolute beta
Music please
#Fly this is what happened to OG when u left
1sec
31:45 did notail said pota?😂😂
This true sight I wouldn't like to miss every single second. The best True sight
worst and most biased crowd ever
Chek This New Update Costom Hero Clash it's Fun @UCPOaQZW_rFddMutsFEv_6pw
OG = Chinese Dota Slayers this season for real. They absolutely deserved this win!

"THE BEST TRUE SIGHT.

Props to the team, you make this shit so alive.
Please, always make some emotion on every single True Sight you make, Valve and teams!

The wait is over, your community is on fire again.
Once again, thank you. Thank you so much!"

"FY is my all time favourite Asian player - he deserved it so much. But the better Team won. 
Most likely the best DotA Team ever!"
57:00

IT IS A TRADITION THAT WE WATCH THIS ONCE IN  A WHILE.
5:30 AHAHHAHAHAH. FUCK YOU! CR1T DUMBASS
"2018 Thompson:  zues i think...I dint know...

"YouTube:How many times you watch this
Me:Yes"
"Dude, I don't usually comment, but let's just say I had to like and comment this video!"
9:21 n0tail cancelled ET stomped so storm got caught by Jerax.
"Game 3: Go Home OG
Game 5: OG IS YOUR TI8 CHAMPION"
ON EST SUR LES NERFS
"58:15 hits hard, I feel like losing ti finals is worse than not getting to play finals. Just knowing that you could have won. You could have won ti. But you didnt."
"I cannot imagine how hard it must been for NoTail to trust someone, right after he got stabbed by his best buddy."
55:36
"59:04 ""We got to play in the Finals ana, and we did it!"" Notail, jerax and ana were the only players left in OG after Ti7 and the betrayal of brotherhood. The others lost faith and left. But maybe that was for the greater good."
Holyshitt ceb holding a bunch of paper
I didnt even hear topson say a single thing lol
"40:04 Notail  ""On est sur les mères !"""
When the god ask for ember 😂
"Not gonna lie , after 2 wins in a row i was scared! i was like will OG lose after coming this far!!!
GAME 3 - THEY WIN 
GAME 4- THEY WIN
hopes came back
i still remember it CEB saying- THIS IS THE DAY PICK WHAT EVER HERO YOU  ARE COMFORTABLE WITH, we got this !
Damn goosebumps guys!!"
Anyone have an idea what Somnus is eating before the game? are those vitamins? what
Back here for the 5th time.
Og fans are so good supporteers
52:14 her armpit started COVID-19
ASA ANG ML HA
"the look in the LGD's face, full of pride. That's the reason why they lose two years in a row"
2k20 ?
2x cumback by OG. wtf ame what have u done. why did u tp at shrine
34:10 GO home OG .... Here take an Axe
"CEB is such a good leader. Keeps everyone focused, reads enemy strategy very well. He's really behind all of this."
rewatching this for the 194 times
Let's see how many people watched this again in October 2020
Ame choked so hard
"at 53:52, the guy wearing the OG mask was ahead of his time."
Whos here after quarantine? Lols
"Ceb it's real, Ceb it's real 🌻🌻🌻"
I miss The International 😞
The 11 million dollars  buyback by ana that turn the final game around
Это можно смотреть вечно
55:14 damnn the moment notail hit the fact that they just won a fvcking TI 🥰😭
"Black Panther : ""Get this man a shield""
Ceb : ""Get this guy an invoker"""
12:41 nope
"1 lose away from being eliminated

Jerax: Ana you wanna relo into the base ? 
Ana: No no no
Jerax: Memes"
The fan at 24:05 predicted what's gonna happen in the tournament
"The ending is what makes this special. The triumph, the despair, the glory, the disappointment, the disbelief and the resolution of both sides. Showing both sides of the coin, for each victor there is a loser. Made me shed a tear for both sides.
Thanks for the masterpiece."
Ame choked so hard on that last game
58:47 theres no revenge kid
I love how the OG plays
Me after watching ti9 true sight
"31:09 как Джеракс угарает с Себа,когда тот материться по-французски"
"52:01

jerAx shouting gives me goosebumps man"
The contrast between 41:40 and 41:49 is real
26:59 Ana’s death stare! You already something bad is going to happen for the opponent
"The way they disrespect Ceb, lol!! Take the L LGD gays"
Imagine they let ceb pick centaur
Nice 👍
42:47 15 thousand hours of dota 😱
"That look on jerax at 52:53 is so amazing, conveys so much. Also can anyone translate what notail is saying then?"
Anyone still watch this video?
China always trashtalk .. egos more
Rewatching this right now and still gaves me chills 🥶
Ending is just so hard to watch
Jerax is lowkey Ana's fanboy.
"This TI is fcking awesome, even Notail forgot to get his beautiful shoes after winning the TI."
F*ck i really missed Jerax right now.
Каждый раз до слёз 😍
This and the other valve documentary called Free To Play brings joy and tears to the eyes
My daily music 🎶
"Hello, I want to talk to you about our company's business cooperation. Please contact me! You will get rich returns, and our company guarantees that you can get commissions every day. This is my (Telegram) APP account +91 98324 60427"
Ceb is just a good team leader .....  lack of motivation
Am I gonna watch a true sight I have already watched? Hell yea I am! This is hyped as F!
55:38 快进到烟火声
That Turtle beated you twice
the LGD just like a bad character in chinesse movie
Their kunkka pick was very poor choice
"I honestly tear up every time I watch this.
And at this point that's a lot of tears."
2020 and this still got my chills
Yeah he jinx it
the best team in dota history
"Wise words from Chalice

""Fucking shit, dont jinx us"""
No matter what keep playing boys
чё за турик?
2020 and still speechless
"Crowd - go home og!

OG-  Yeah! With an aegis."
59:45 :cccc
"FY: Calm and composed captain.
Somnus: Calm and did his best.
xNova: ""come pick me up mom, I'm scared.""
Ame: ""what about if I throw?""
Chalice: ""YEEEEEEET WHERE ARE YOU GUYS? KEEP YOUR TP AND EYES ON THE MAP!"""
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that N0tail is not wearing shoes while lifting the aegis??
This video is more like a motivational video because of ceb..
The best TI
35:41 The guy with the mask knew about the virus
I want to play. Play play play play play play dota.
PSG.LGD They lose bec they dont deserve it
"BigDaddy deserve it.
feel sorry about fy god, he is so great, but dota is a 5-men game."
What an emotional journey!
no one has noticed that Angel ? 29:48
55.36 is the face that have a lot and a fucking lot of meaning and it is fucking beautiful
It is interesting for me to watch for a non-dota player
"The translations for the Chinese curse words are way too friendly, they were using some pretty harsh phrases haha"
"That's why i like OG and Ceb because he never look down on his opponents
Thats why they deserve the tittle"
"Stop playing Dota >> watch this >> goosebumps >> burn MMR > stop playing DotA, again."
Sometimes I just watch this when I want a pick me up... then I end up holding back tears at the end.
"56:10 ""we won TI WTF"""
31:10 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHAH
oppa oppa boys -ceb
38:33
1 year later and I still didn't find that strechy pants that looks like jeans.
44:14 OG had a positive spirit and energy thats why they won
"go home CORONA! go home CORONA ! 
FUCK CHINA"
"Show the freaking game, pleeeeaase! Who the hell wants to see the crowd?"
fucking Coronavirus
"54:45, the  face of the girl made me feel sorry, because I wanted to OG win and they won"
25:18 JINXED MOMENT in HISTORY of ESPORT
Storms face when he try steal the ageis..... 💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️💀
"Difference between mentality of both teams is so immense. Chinese team is like a well oiled machine, they do what they do perfectly, they have perfectly analyzed enemy and know every move, until enemy starts improvising. EU team is like an animal, not perfect, but very adaptive and resilient, fighting till the end against all odds. It's kind of like like a terminator fighting an dinosaur."
Go home OG more like go home china man
No matter you win or lose if you are rude as fuck. I hate them.
Ceb is a role model leader.
"Ceb its real! Ceb c'mon its real! 

really gets me every goddamn time"
I keep coming back to see the pain reflected on the faces of the  chinese audience and players from LGD .... so satisfying to watch.
: `)
Quck you china!
What can i say. For me is the best stress reliever. Already watched it almost 50 times. XD
On est sur les nerfs
"Go home og... Go home og 
LOL"
"When OG got 2 losses, Ceb motivated his team about being tested.
When LGD got 2 losses, FY complained about the draft and all the mistakes his team made.
That's when I knew OG was going to win."
the losing team is always smoking cigarettes
55:00
"Muka muka kesombongan jadi lesu pas di akhir wkwkwkw, LGD LGD 😂😂 trash"
Somnus is so freakin cocky
11:31 is that w33 in the back?
I'LL DESTROY HIM. AND THEN HE DID
"""Go Home OG"" they called it"
19:42 like wtf?
"Team that win 1st game always lose xD
By LGD"
Goosebumps everytime hearing n0tail's first line.
Ceb's attitude was the best thing in this whole awesome True Sight
im kinda sad chinese team spiraling down after this final happen
Idk why this still makes me tear up every time I watch it
Guess he's not taking that jacket off...
I still get goosebumps everytime I watch this. TI8 final is legendary
This movie should get all the Oscars... it has everything
anyone know soundtrack from 49.01?
Jerax with the game winning call 52:00 Man up guys MAN UP
what was Ana watching at 2:46? hehe
Notail deserves this
The reason why OG is the best team is it's because of trust and friendship that they help and support each other to unleash their maximum potential.
"They were all talented players, but the mindset for ti pressure decided the winner👍"
@11:33 you can see casually walking on the street man XD
I like ceb at game 4
Watching chinese crowd crying like a little bitch is so satisfying. HAHAHAHA
fly was the problem. LOL
Shit i miss dota
"Somnus looks like a really badass villain here especially when he said, Kunkkaaaa.






I'm gonna quit in ML, and play dota again."
14:43 Kunkaaaaaa. 🔥
"27:19 give this boii invoker  💕💕

"49:47
Ceb: topias zeuz ana ember
Notail: Johan Prophet anybody?
😂😂😂😂😂"
52:52 look at jerAx getting emotional on how beautiful they drawed up the play
Best ti!!!
я ауе мальчишка
Lgd only lacks motivation
True sight is so fun to watch I really miss ti10
52:52 Jerax in the verge of crying because he knows that the game is in the bag now.
Ame got a single dialogue and thats it lol
14:45 for Somnus’ “Kunkkaaaaaaaa”
"""That was some kerygasm shit"""
"48:24 Ceb: ""Stay strong, boys""."
Notail is suck

N0tail holding back tears as they were going for throne man.
I hate OG with my guts but you can't help but admire how they pulled this off. Still crazy!

"It's my 999999 time watch this, btw jerax posture while playing is somehow iconic"
42:50 they are fucking serious
unraveled
2020 i still watch this shit
"15k hours in dota to be a pro, bruh. True Sight is so high quality project production... its my fav kind of shit to watch, amazing."
20:07 I just realized that fckin laugh😅
"Does it give you joy that Fly said ""all the best to LGD"" after losing to them in LB and then this happens"
"What language they are saying ""we are on edge"""
"35:56 ""pl 25 guys"" that suspense sound give me chillssss"
"I think there have been some exceptional individual players in Dota 2. Starting from 2012 to the present day. But I think with what n0tail did with OG, he cemented himself as the best the game has ever seen. A true visionary of the game. From being relegated. He took nobodies and made them hold the aegis twice. Amazing."
"""GO HOME OG"""
Tusk King made in china
7:28 did i hear 2019 or just me
"Ceb: today is our day

ceb2019: ohh fuck man this is our year 😂😂"
im watching this w/ Sumail
This is like the real movie lol when the underdog beat the juggernaut
The global silence though... with matching sad and disappointed faces haha
ITS NOW 2020 BUT IM STILL WATCHING IT
"""we are gonna be right here Ana"".....got me"
PSG.LGD underestemated OG thats why they lost
"People say the most useless thing in your life is the people who don’t happy for success
Meanwhile
OG coach : really!!!!!!... 😂😂😂"
The best ti final. Ever. Even surpassing ti3.
Zai actually got to true sight aswell 11:33
35:10 the moment when Ana won the 4th game
Where is Ana’s eul play?
china mother fucker
When they chant go home og but the reality  speak go home LGD 😂
"I swear to God, this is the most iconic and the best TI in the history."
I'm still watching this moment
Ceb trashtalker impolite he should be punished
the best fucking TI
Can I request CEB to massage me? (no homo bro). haha
"38:47

savin for later"
LGD ARE DICKS INCLUDING THEM FANS LOL!! NEVER WIN AGAINST THE GANGSTA’S OF OG!!
TBH 39:05 is the most memorable moment in this entire video
The gameplay + sound design in this video is absolutely incredible. Where do they find all these amazing instrumental songs? Someone please open my horizons
Big daddy Narutail
"im gonna show this to my kids. ""the greatest battle of all time"""
25:18 the real reason LGD lost
"FY : How dare pick Axe infront of Tusk King? 
a moment later : Ceeeeeeeeeeebb!"
LGD: what if they call GG and we miss it? Haaaaaah haaaaah 🤣
"I dont know, but i hate seeing somnus face. I dont know why 😂"
"Let's be honest, guys:

We were not fans of OG before their miraculous win at TI8. And I don't think anyone would expect that they would win. And this what makes OG one, if not the greatest teams of all time. They defied the odds by becoming what is the highest achievement of a DOTA 2 player. And I'm proud that I'm one of those fans who weren't before but now are avid ones. These moments will become legends of tomorrow."
Who’s watching this over and over no need to like just comment here xD
Fun fact fy bought his mom a house with the ti money when he played with vici gaming at ti4
"Crowd: 58:47 Take your revenge next year!!!
""""TI9""""
OG: Not this year, maybe next year again"
Come here everytime I need some inspiration
"Did fy said they buyback for this aegis, yeah for this first aegis"
That the way ah ah ah i like it 😂
"Ceb is the pure leader
.."
i’m not crying you’re crying
BIGPapaNotail most achievement in dota 2 history??
"37:27 JerAx: ana, memes?
Ana: Fuck off.
JerAx: :D"
"Если мне придется играть в финале интернешенала, я сыграю свою лучшую игру.
До слез"
"-""You said you really like Invoker?""
-""Yeah.""
-""Give the boy Invoker.""
One of the best for me here."
31:44 translation?
and somnus never had the chance to take his jacket off
Jerax please come back
12:42 is true to TI9
Ana probably have no idea what's going on this entire time. Even after winning and arriving back to his house lol. He look so confused.
Imagine losing to OG that they create a corona pandemic as revenge For stopping 2020 TI ahah
LGD was never the same after this.
"Ceb, a fucking coach, motivator, amd a brother to teammates. Damn"
vindication at its purest form.
17:45 notail smokong in no smokong area bro
As much as i like TI9 with 2 top team that i love. This TI8 final is really something. Damn this corona kills me.
Best anime ever
this is the perfect example of David vs Goliath
"I just love how much trust the put on Topson this entire series, made sure that he was comfortable with his game no matter what"
Best Ti Ever
"At 50:45 notail and jerax celebrating ana being alive with cursed from silencer, then ceb is there acts like their father and jerax from 😂 to 🤐"
"In redbull truesight like for ti8, during the drafting of game 5 OG were drafting what's their favorite heroes. It's like they are having fun on game 5 but they still won the game. And that's the real mindset of Dota2 Champion"
15 thousand hours. Whatever they have. I have more than them.
"I will always come back here to watch again this magical moment.
:')"
Legend says Somnus can't still take off the jacket.
Lmfao Jerax playing TI for memes
Fly after seeing OG winning back to back TI: 👁👄👁
"Haters: TI8 was a fluke. LGD should have won it.

OG: Both us and LGD looked into the abyss. But when it looked back, LGD blinked."
"Jerax: Memes?

Ana: F*ck off"
"Испытываю крейгазм даже сейчас, я люблю вас ог"
"If you hear Ceb saying ""We're going to fuck them, don't worry about it"" you bet your ass they will."
Maan... Back in the days where everyone can still go out
"2 am in the morning watching this, shaking in excitement like i'm seeing this for the first time, crying and high on emotions...man OG really gave us the best games there, they really deserved it. Props to LGD, they are indeed the team to beat during ti8. man...just what Notail said, ""I fucking love this game"""
anyone still watching? dude still gives me chills
"Look at those chinese fans faces. Just makes me laugh.

Don't talk shit to your opponent if the game/series is not yet finished."
I hope they would make Dynasty next TI. Can't fucking wait for it
This Ti finals was breath taking..
TI8 was deffinently the best TI so far!
Please translate what Ceb is saying during that Axe game. Thanks in advance. 😘
ung buntong hininga ni notail hbng binabasag ang throne!! super totoo!!!
dont judge a book by its cover somnus . got it ?
"ive played dota ever since it came out watched this a million times still a hard stuck divine 2 rank player and still dont know how od's multiplier works and oracle is still broken SEA server is STILL the most toxic server    AM STILL need like 50 minute farmed to be usefull guardian rank players still blame lag when they get outplayed miranas model is still outdated and dota is still free yet so EXPENSIVE wind ranger is still unatractive(for me atleast)well until her arcana realises then maybe id smash dota is a 
P E R F E C T game"
I came here to remind everyone that this is the best True Sight and also the best TI ever.
There should be an anime about notail's dota life
Subcribe Like Coment ^_^...
Still one of the best opening scene in cinematic 😭
Team work vs individual over confidence.. ..lol..
I have never played dota but still notail's story is inspiring
"FY: teams that win game 1 always lose the finals.

2017 team liquid: am I joke to you?"
this never gets old! N E V E R ! ! ! O G forever!
still getting goosebumps till this day
Ceb is really a saviour..nun nawalan ng pag.asa c ana..

The best TI story is TI8 isn’t it
"59:46 always gets me. ALWAYS. 

I've watched this a couple of times, and I get beyond emotional there. It's just perfect."
"Ana in this TI not boring, unlike TI 9 wkwkwk"
55:13 that's when the bigdaddy realized that they've done the impossible
game 5 OG: choose your best hero
Ceeeeeeeeeeeb
Go home OG? i think DISBAND PSG. August 2020
So sad LGD only Somnus and Fy doing great. Ame so bad on this TI8
Don't mind me. I'm just here for Jerax' IO meme.

"TI8 plays are amazing , sucks that they didn't put a small screen for every plays they did."

"8:47 getting over confident
9:24 face of the dumbass"
Hello ho sir gnda ng mga movie mo mga english tlga
"Be honest
No matter how toxic ceb is
U just wanted them to win cause they speak English"
AXE!
56:30 The way ana shake hands with the defeated team while his teammates are celebrating is full of humbleness. That's freaking dope! jeeez #dreamOG
27:12  I am imagining that I am in Topson’s place right now. It might be stressful and pressure to choose the final mid hero for final game. But he still in his best choice to choose his best hero. GGWP.
19:40 yeaa!!
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB
"Me: watches true sight to gain motivation from og

12:48 I can hear Karen.
"55:18 no matter how many times i watched this, it will always made me cry 😭 the amount of hard work and patience that notail has been given, and finally a ti champions. damn this is why i love notail, he doesn’t give up. not even once. this is the reason why fly doesn’t have an aegis into his name, not much hard work and patience 🙃"
there is no fucking TI so i have to watch old Sight . Well played chinese.
"OG's story is like a shonen anime betrayed anf looked down upon rose to the top and proved they have what it takes, But told it was just luck and fluke, So now they have to prove it again and when they proved it they did it with style and domination and now the current OG is what would happen if the story of the protagonist would continue, the new generation comes and the old continues it's legend."
"2:48 , is ana watching americas got talent?"
when boasting hits you the hardiest way 😊
"31:04 JeRax, casually can't play because of a laught XD"
"The chemistry inside OG, is very very different with LGD"

Greatest series in Esports history
"56:12 N0tail - ""Fly, why are you not with me at this moment..."""
31:01 what language is that and what is the meaning?
52:00 OG's conversation here still gives me shivers no matter how many times I already watched this TI
Because of this corona virus i already memories all the word that they said even chinese.HAHAHA

"Alright, that's it, somebody make an anime based on Team OG and I would binge watch it."
"If this TI showed anything, it's that FY is the best support that has ever played this game. He is just in another level ... Proud OG fan since 2016"
I think i like suess
29:50 I need her IG for research purposes plzz

That anime feels when fy asking where is ceb then the rest is history
"ame only speak like 1 sentence in this whole fking video.

Why i always watch this💕
witcher netflix

"I watch this series countless times but here I go again, still watching. This is the best and legendary series of Dota 2 history. I can't help it, my tears are falling w/o noticing it. My great respect to PSG LGD and my heartfect gratitude to team OG esp. to Ceb the most important player of the team, he thinks positive and enjoyed the game, he's the one who bring the team together."
5:42 GREATEST MYSTERY IN DOTA 2 HISTORY

Жизнь нужно прожить так что бы кто то обнимал тебя как Йохан обнимает Аегис

WHEN YOUR POS 5 HOLD THE AEGIS TO have 6 slot item

"Ceb is 80% playing and 20% ""fuck him, fuck them, we will fuck """
CEB is the one winning them multiple TIs. I mean look at him so calm n so motivating and the way he played that Axe with that confidence. I just love to watch CEB.... Slay Slay Slay....Ceeeeeeeeeebbbbbbbbb.....
Nice anime. 10/10 will watch again.
Somnus is  really a cocky bastard

Ana and notail the tandem.

"I've watch this so many times and still addicted to it this for me the best ti and true sight, the drama the comebacks was so unreal it was like a movie, and I'm a big fan of og since day one."
"Dota Trader face to face heroes from TI10 collectors pick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsXV4nYFpy0"
Somnus speak cao ni ma
"Thats why never celebrate too early
The fans: Go home OG after the comeback 🤐"
hi guys I am sergyad
"Some one help me , pls. What was said by ceb at 12:29? Can someone write the sentence said?"
#borntobechamp
55:20 that keyboard piece tho
"27:23 What you came for..







No?, Just me? U.U"
1.8k Dislikes - League of Legends Player lmao 🤣
Lol lgd talk shit second game but in the end they lost lol
2020 07. 10. Still has goosebumps
i cant get over with this movie
"fy: They dare to pick Axe against Tusk king?
Ceb: Hold my Axe."
"> they play so messy
> lose the game
bro, cringe."
Hambugon daw ni si somnus hayp na ni
"I can't even see my own hero.

-ana2018"
"even at the end LGD coudlnt say anything, they werent playing bad, OG was just too good damn"
22:11 that’s sick
Their win is my win...
I love to see the Chinese fans so devastated because LGD lose i hate Chinese fans because they're so confident there team well T.I guess what karmas a bitch
I've watched this so many times now but the goosebumps are still there.
The most positive people on dota i ever knew.. young as me but very wise as my father.. -ceb- lol
"TI10 Collector items are the best cache set so far, check this guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4WlpOaJnto&t=3s"
"can anyone estimate, how many battle pass level was that ODPixel's Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb chant equivalent to?? :D"
"39:04 ""i mean i don't even know what's going on i can't see my own hero"" 

Yup that's the guy who won Ti Twice in a row legend has it he won both Ti's and he still can't see he's character"
Ana and Ceb hard carried TI8 then Ti9 came then they all carried lol
"Awesome
The way they highlighted too, like cinematic too good."
"Am I the only one that gets emotional at this? Idk why, I usually don’t feel this way about anything, but this video made me cry tears of joy."
anyone where i can find the music at 7:20 ?
Talk too much and you lose. Too much confidence can make you disappoint. Too much happiness it will back to you 2 times of pain. That's reality so don't be full to yourself every game.
this is the most iconic TI in dota 2 scene ever.
Love how OG didn't even talk anything about the game during their breaks whereas LGD did exactly the opposite
OG FANGAY 💙
"""I'm cool with anything"" - Ceb looks like the coolest person on earth."
25:16 he really jinxed it
I hate lgd because they have such a huge head
50:34 probably the most thrilling moment for jerax as he was not expecting ana to survive wahaha and notail's reaction at that moment was so fun to watch 😂
"28:29 if you have a coin, thank me later. Watching during quarantine."
rip ti10
"Need jerax ana and ceb to back again, so og can live once more to conquer TI for three rows"
"То есть, китайцы не видели ЛАКАД МАТАТАД НОРМАЛИН НОРМАЛИН???? Кинули в мут ог........ капец"
Notail the best
"Ana: Not to long ago, I was watching ABC fucking kid show and now im here again"
Re-watching this again for the nth time. Props to Notail's Game 5 Prophet totally controlling Somnus' Kunkka. Kunkka did less to nothing in that final Rosh pit fight.
Global silence to all chinese crowd
"this is crazy , i’ve watched 15 times and im not bored. i still can feel the emotion omg💪💪 whoopaaa slay🥶"
Enpañol? :c
Best TI finals
"Everyone's like with a serious face, Somnus with his death stare, Fy blinking with attitude. 3:50
Then there's Topias smiling to whatever Ceb is saying. 3:58
I love OG, hope Sumail becomes a consistent and longtime player of OG."
"TI8 is the most epic TI they said....







I'm not disappointed."
"Chalice:  fvcking shit, don't jinx us.


Hahahahahaha"
"What ever your going to pick, we gonna destroy that with it.. 

Pity face makes my Filipino spirit lift up"
"TI7 is what made me love this DOTA 2's championship,but it is undeniable to say that this TI8 was the most amazing,vibrant and beautiful esports event to have ever existed. 
If we add the splendid production of these True Sights from Valve, it just makes it even better."
"23:41 SUMIYA : ""niubi""
30:58 CEB: ""enculé de ta mère, va te faire foutre"" Jerax's laughs & says ""aaaaa"" = exactly my expression
34:05 2K non-believers : GO HOME OG!
56:32 Ana is still focusing on the priority even when the game has ended while everyone else is losing their minds. to shake hands their opponents"
https://youtu.be/n35WnOmkniE
ana is cold blooded
"Ceb mastermind, Jerax meemer, Noyail captain, Ana god and Topson best player in dota 2 cant win that, new og is good but it will never be like this one and in ti9!"
my 5th time watching this
12:43 🤐
"quarantine seaaon 5 
me: ok time to watch true sight again and again and again"
"watching this again for ""the idk how many times"", but dang it. this is brilliant. Good Job, Valve!"
I love it when china loses hope
why theres no game7
43:04 that feeling was like an Anime scene in Kuroko's last game lol that's hyped af
"Famous last words:
""where's axe?""
FY 2018"
These LGD men talks shit all the time against OG while OG only talks about the game. And OG sends them back to china with their ass crying lol
47:37 losers reaction
"Watching it over and over again.
""Give the boy his Invoker!"""
49:48 i almost cried.
still tears me up to this day ...
Who's here to get some motivation?
Oppa oppa boys HAHAHAHA
such a wholesome team both of them are!
52:52 my fav part
I still get chills watching this game every time.
Look at those nerds
The way notail and ceb call chen pl really chill me
29:38 hahahah. My gooood..
Ana is just so fucking good
"whoever made this video called ""TRUESIGHT"" salute to you brotha, I got nothing but respect for you."
All of that just to win a poor man's shield...
You know those boss fight when u manage to kill it n ur char get a huge boost in power n lvl? Yeah thats OG VS PSG LGD. They level up so much after winning against lgd that they are just so damn good
I like the expression of their faces when they lost
Best True Sight of All Time
OG vs Corona
"Luqid,EG,Serect and psg.lgd is great team 
They can play as same as OG but those team did not past the the same things like OG.
ONLY BIGDADDY NOTAIL CAN DO it."
"That's the difference between friendship having fun while playing than playing DOTA with only price in mind, This TI is the most memorable to me,  it shows that no matter how you fall down just keep on  keep pushing till you get want you want, it doesn't matter if your friend leave you just believe that there will be someone who acknowledge you"
"That Chalice is so arrogant
then he lose to Ember....."
Best True Sight (y)
"I don't care, win or loose. We play! -the best line from a cool coach."
Even now i watch this tears welling up
14:44.  KUUNNKAAA. nice
"Look at the face 55:43 , i feel you sir"
"How lucky OG that they have Ceb on their team. A team need people like Ceb, who has nice attitude, never give up, always giving his teammates optimistic, calm person and a person who has winner mentality!"
I still get the chills when ceb calls of his lifetime play
"You're so fcking cute ana😆

-Jerax"
"Someone has got to appreciate the amazing cinematography and the editing is so dammn good
+rep to the production team behind the whole package."
40:43 and 42:30 ceb.. realy. Hats off.
"Really wanted to know that background music at 7:20 before starting the first game, it really hypes the game"
Where's Axe?
"After this TI, topson just got Nerfed big time"
See lgd is full of pride but og is full of humble and concentration
"""It dosent matter,it dosent really matter""
the best call in TI history..."
That music reminds me so much of Interstellar. Pure love.
Somnus picking kunka in game 2 feels very confident
I can't even see my hero..ana😂😂
"""It doesn't matter"" -ana, what a savage."
You know OG's winning when Ceb speaks his own language.
"What are the pills lgd take, just curious"
CEB'S CALL OF HIS LIFETIME! ICONIC ❤️
"""They dare pick to pick Axe infront of the Tusk king""
There's a huge difference between a God and a King"
Dude. I literally just watched this true sight for the 6th time and i enjoyed like the first time i did. Dont know about you guys but for me its one of the best moovies at YouTube. So fucking emotional. You can feel the truth of every player.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH NOTAIL!!
I've watched this countless of times and I still get the same hype. HAHAHA.
The power of Flowers and Friendship.. OG
Even im an Asian Filipino to be specific im so happy for OG they deserve to win they just enjoying playing dota
52:51
54:58 ******* mo from the bottom of my heart hahaha
55:12 is the facial expression of someone who can see the moment he has waited for his whole life...
49:46 just focus in the game guys. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Still thrilling.
"Im gonna say, i admire og's attitude to stay positive."
I wish the matchmaking was fair as TI games.
"What i learn from this video was 
LGD keep blaming there mistake everytime they lose and when they are winning they felt confident to win everthing.
While on OG side win they win or lose they keep motivating their whole team not focus on their mistake on the game just keep telling your team we can do this

Thats what i called pure teamwork  all for one one for all"
Better than TI 9
"""Guys Win or Lose we dont care we play"" I love that fcking mindset dude"
una mierda la verdad eh
Ceeeeeb!!!
I came here to watch them Chinese people cry over their LGD.
Ceb is just a fountain of Motivation. I need someone like him!
Topson default skin
2:40 my dude
"They literally showed like 3% of the gameplay in this vid.
F*cking cut-scenes at the end of every fight!
This true sight is just terrible compared to ti9's one."
WHOS WATCHING THIS AT 2020?
"N0tail : Ceb u carry so hard

"37:28 LMAO ""Memes?"" Nice Jerax HAHAHA"
"“So how many times have you watch this?” 

Me: Yes"
12:25 Thats the way uhuh uhuh i like it
6:30 that smile makes you sad in the last part
What's the song that starts at 37:00 ?
"why OG WIN TI? 
LGD Team is good team ... BUT 
OG Team no good ... but ....have 5 BOY family .. love it play dota  all the time this is OG no more ...."
"When ceb says ""BUTO"" then notail shouted it. Damn jerax he laughs like he understands ""BUTO"""
Ana's ember= godtier
did notail just said puta? haha
"Look at that Notail face and remember only one really important thing. 
The battle roar"
Ame looks so humble..
Heres the reason why they released the wuhan virus... Give them a break OG. Let them win TI10...
2020 here👋 still watching
"11th time watching this, Feels bad for FY"
I watched this over 10 times and still gives me chills!
"Nc Quote There:
""A Heart Vs Closer to Machine Perfection,LGD"""
"When ceb says ""This is my game boys"" gives me chills"
Wtf heroes have different names in chinese?!!! What did they call invoker?!! Or spectre ?!!!
"Chalice just stayed at the top of the Rosh taking all of its attack so that when anna Bought back, he just died with a single slight and Chains Combination XD"
"Casters: Laughing at OG for finding last minute replacements for Fly and s4

OG: Wins TI8

Casters: Surprised Pikachu face"
30:57
"Still watching 2020, cry hard psg.lgd..."
i hope there is ti8 eg vs og true sight
LGD is too over-confident. Too cocky
48:25 how to comfort a carry
the editor of this video is a god (sorry for my grammar ^_^)
The greatest comeback.. the greatest team from open qualifiers.. team from scratch to aegis holder.. this is the greatest moment of ti for me.. go og for the threepeat
This game 4 never gets old
56:10 are you looking for your missing friend notail?
"58:47 
Take your revenge next year?
Yeah, ABOUT THAT.."
Lets go watch those 5 games back 2 back bois
Watch this vid>getting hype>queue in rank>get fucked by random teammate.
"The LGD player's attitudes were so bad it was hard to watch. Making themselves look bad and for everything they're representing. 
Loved how they were mocking OG on how did their research and had papers haha too. Maybe you should go and do the same because they beat you. So glad OG won."
OG THE BEST!!!
"Be a man like ceb Knows how to calm himself and his team.
Be a man like ceb who motivates.
Be a man like ceb who sees positivity. 
Be a bad ass man like ceb who talk shits just to calm you. 
For surely you can pass negativities.
 i admire him as a role model."
"28:54 
Ceb: this is my game boizz........ Few moments later... 
Ceeeeeeeeeeeebbbbbbbbbbbbb"
"Ræpə×LS
RZR
S0N
DAMNboii"
"27:17 look at notail. I think if they did lose the game4 then og holding the aegis wont happen, they might kick topson"
"no matter how many times i watch this, i always got chills on ceb's call!!!"
Does anyone know the name or link for the song that starts at 7:14
2020 and still watching this
No body deserves this more than notail
It all started in manila major
Wtf that axe buyback scene 🔥🔥🔥
man imagine TI3 true sight...
Ceb clutch plays in game 4...wow...legendary!
Do you hear what OD pixel said. Ladies and gentle where here on 2019 international dota2 game 🤣🤣🤣
Sound 30:27?  Help plz)
"OG losing game 3..notail: what u think ana?
Ana: it doesnt matter"
"I swear those bananas are helping OG win, somebody should totally nerf that fruit"
Cry chinese go home LGD hahaha
Text you can hear: Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
39:05 Ana is damn cute
Still best TI for me.
"the big diffrence on this two team on game V:
LGD : blame your teammate..
OG : lets have fun..."
"Wow, this is my 14th time watching this during quarantine"
"damn that moment when they won it, the look on n0tail's face men it looks like he is seeing everything that has happened to him that year"
"In 4 game of TI8 grandfinals og first pick was io,and in the 4 game of TI9 grandfinals og first pick was again io"
"Ceb's such a good coach, he's coaching even when he's playing."
"A God said:""I can't even see my own heroes"""
Ceb is one hell of a motivator!
"55:13

NoTail want to burst but did not celebrate until the thrown is down. 

Great hold of emotions IMO"
"Ana you wanna get back to their base? Meme (After saving Ana) 

Ana : fuck off"
"Chen , PL?
Yeaah? 
Yeah. Yeaah!
19:39"
"What if they call Gg and we didn't hear them.


Lol"
Last Game PSG good Early Game.. why not push Mega crep
52:52 like power ranger transformation
They win first game in finals and lol it backfire to them they lose shit happens 😂✌️
"56:33 man. . .much respect for ana, so pro but yet also down to earth"
"Iam not playing dota but,the feeling is playing me rn"
Ceb's motivations is insane
Wtf i cryng for my idol jerax 😭
"52:52 Jerax,Topson,N0tail, and Ceb: Yes! let's Go!

Ana: Wooah"
52:56 Ttttt.. TALO NA PRI
Most beautiful natural reaction of achieving your biggest dream on 55:13
47:38 Dont Celebrate too early boii
watching this in 2020 still gives me goose bumps
I'm fucking pretty sure 90% of dislikers are chinese
"Ceb: Awwwee I feel bad for 'em
Also Ceb: no I don't feel bad for 'em fuck 'em"
This shows how arrogant Chinese are lol (but not all)
"Watched this again 2k20, still gives me goosebumbs.  From underdogs to champions."
"If fy is the magician of the position 4, then what will you call JerAx?"
Still get me emotional 2020
24:23 there’s literally a no smoking sign right behind him 😂
"44:03 Ceb: ""So, just fscking enjoy it."""
CEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBB!
"Masyadong mayabang si Somnus, yan talo hahaha"
38:16 dweeyoleh
"Ceb : i feel bad for them

Literaly a second later

Ceb : no...i dont feel bad for them, fuck em.

Lmao"
13:54 i feel bad for them also him i dont feel bad for them fuck them
Ana : CaNt EvEn SeE mY hErO
best fucking TI.
"Paris Saint Germain, but all Chinese players."
4:29 like shroud
Quarantine really making me watch TI8 for the 4th time huh
"I hope maybe in the coming year I will play in TI,who knows how much TI but I am sure I will play there with the name of the team and the country where I live."
Somnus' kunkka is so good I wish we had seen more of it
when to much trash talk...lose
the best 1 hour of my life
25:18 he jinxed it xD
The legendary banana wins the tournament
I think Ceb was the most important player in TI8. He never let his team give up. He kept pushing the team to keep fighting. And what a way to win. PSG LGD was at their best this tournament and still lost.
"OMG 52:00 i never tired of watching this momment, when Jessie turn on God Mod. ""win or lose,we don't care, we play"" -Ceb-."
"The International Magic, it is a marvelous occasion to witness the culmination of hard work and dedication to an art form which is DotA."
It's a heart-broken tournament for a PSG.LGD fan. Every time I watch this I still feel upset. But I have to say you gotta respect Notail. I think he is like a Kobe Bryant in Dota2 world. Everyone from OG in TI8 is unbeleivable.  TI finals at its best.
"50:47
JerAx Gae moments"
I love this game so much - n0tail
"Jerax: ""aNa you're so fucking good!""
aNa:  :|"
Respect to the Chinese players for taking it with stride. You played well.
Notail is my inspiration he smoked 5times in just 1hour and now i can smoke a cigarette 10 times in 1hour so thank u so much notail u are my inspiration
Its time for TI10 boys
"""we are on the edge"" what language ceb used? French?"
"damn wfh make me watch this movie agains

""""WHERE's  AXE???""""

''""CCCCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"""""""""
2020 still watch
LGD from China is a noob team
who's here because of Ti 2020 ?
Every time i come back to this i lose 100 mmr
"chalice: @50:23 What are they doing? feeding? 
too full of himself
kuroky: OG is the Best."
Game 4 is the best dota match of all time.
Hahaha this is the diff between playing with passion and playing like a robot
49:47 Ceeeeeeeeeb Called his Team
Go home OG???????? LOSER😛
"Hello guys and ladies.
can you please tell me if i see right in 36:40 when PL throw nulifier into their own invoker or im just idiot :D
Edit: and yes this is because of quarantine."
"i dropped tears when Kuro won , and then BigDaddy great camptains BTW !"
48:30
"""I think I like Sooos"" GAME FUCKING OVER"
Is It weird I cry every time I watch this?😅
"I am chinese, not from the mainland tho, but i hate chinese if that's making any sense. Most of them are cocky. Not saying all of them but most"
Cebb is holding too many papers  lmao hahahah this statement hits them too hard
China's team after a good teamfight = underestimated their enemy
TUSK KING IS SILENCED? RLY BRUH HAHAHA
This video is so cathartic.
"On Lockdown, can't go outside of house. Shitty internet (Globe), 144p, but I don't care, I will watch this again and again, and again, and again."
"Damn , i dont play but i felt the anger, the passion and commitment to win this game . Now i know why my son love this game so much ."
"the thing is LGD  are afraid to lose but OG aint, they go out there to give everything but having fun at the same time but LGD are too focus lol"
"55:13 that feelings through ups and downs and being betrayed, stay loyal to the team and a never give up spirit. the result is unmeasurable feeling and experience. this is the moment we are going to take the aegis. we are the champion."
"In so may times that I've watched this, it just keep convincing me that jerax was the main component of them winning game 5 ✌️✌️  I mean bro, that fissure steal is bomb"
02:45 Ana just watch youtube. Practice for noob only.
"Fy: They dare to pick axe in front of the tusk king?.
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb"
"i am actually sad how they treated ana, in that year... they r nothing with out him,..."
"this TI just proves when you hit rock bottom, the only way to go is up. kudos to ceb, notail, ana, jerax and topson. they deserved this TI."
"""Win or lose, we fight!"" - Ceb"
One of the best TIs ever.
"At 48:12 is definitely their turning point in game 5. They were already so far behind with 4-15 kills, with 89% chance of winning in favor of LGD. And yet, Ceb remains as the beacon of hope for everyone by spreading positivity. And he did it again in 49:47.

They ended up mentally and emotionally supporting each other, kept believing and risen back together against the odds. After all, Dota is a team game. That's why this OG team roster will forever be the best Dota 2 team ever, IMO."
"When nOtail realized that his dream is within his grasp, waiting for it to be an official call for the win 55:13"
5th time watching this cause i lear so much by just watching them
I really hope they make a tv series inspired by this. It would be really awesome!
"I'm still getting the goosebumps every time I watch this video, especially that ""Ceeeeeeeeeeb"" part. Feels so good!"
trust is the best power.
""" You want me to relo you to the Base ana? For memes""

Ana: Fuck off"
"Topson is this guy for real?


YES"
"Watching this for the 6th time i realized the way they play, unlike most teams who has a plan and follow the strat, OG plays in the moment, they play and adjust accordingly thats why we always see ceb and topson die and dive alot, sometimes the scenario they have in mind doesnt play the way they expect"
55:13 Johan gasping for air knowing he will win TI is so good to see...his heart must be stopping at that moment due to excitement
2:44 When my friend suddenly come to my room while i'm watching porn
Whos still crying after this?
Get lost chinese👎🏼Go Home👎🏼
Jerax and Ceb had a little screentime tbh.
"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCngWPTi-Y9qVdf9wmgAT-Ug
HELP ME REACH MY GOAL 100k SUBS! NEW YOUTUBER HERE GONNA UPLOAD GREAT CONTENT SOON!"
58:56 BigDaddyN0tail aka Joker of Dota 2 (That Laugh Thoo)
i love this movie
14:41 so Invoker is Argh Argh in Chinese.
tusk king xd
"Fy: fkcng hell they dare to pick axe in front of the tusk king? 
Ceb: hold my beer"
FY is Great but he is an idiot trashtalker
who else watching this for the 10000 times?
makanya jan sombong lgd...Kalah kan goblo
Wtf Idk how many times I have watched it and still never gets bored of it.
Quarantine brought me here. Still the most exciting finals
ECQ.
I seriously have corona. before i die I will shout Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb.  fuck i want to play dota.
Learn lesson is DON'T BE EXCITED THE PROCESS
This just prove that mental attitude is wayyy more important than skills alone in order to win a life changing tournament like this..
"Ceb and Notail both is the best motivator and always bring positive vibes for the team, that's why I like OG they're different, they not like common esports team."
"reminiscing the feeling while watching it live and on game 4 I feel tired watching it feels like im the one whos playing with that ana’s pl, maaaaan he’s so good and props to jerax for that Io and cebs axe so commendable hoping for a team like this every pub game 😖"
May 2020??
"PSG.LGD captain should listen to what xnova saying. ""they got zues.better not roshan"". that the turn point for OG. even zues feeding, in late game zeus can play all roles. that is zues. dota 1 legend hero."
"“Ceb is holding a lot of paper”

haha your turn to ban"
This is like the worlds 2019 lmao. Both of the winner are silent but have skills and both of the losers are trashtalker and greedy.
Watching for 4th time still give me chill. Watch it like who's is going to win? 🤣🤣
"If someone wants to watch my channel and subscribe, I record and stream dowry"
12:45 is that u karen?
40:20 That really motivates a player tho .*goosebumps*
"Просто ПСЖ на дизмораличах лузнули. 
Обидненько."
"Why they are the best team and X2 ti winner
Ans: they pick what ever they want to play"
"28:14

Famous Last Words"
Belated happy birthday jerax
"Can somebody told me what Notail and Ceb talk when the moment ""We Are On Edge"" ? And what language is it?"
This Ti finals is the best. Nothing compared with ti 9.
"i hope valve make a ""The Last Dance"" Documentary for OG.. The greatest team dynasty in Dota 2 history!!!"
59:47. The word that make my tears fall. 2 years to reach here and 3 for TI9.
JerAx laughing when  n0tail cursed and Ceb started speaking French at 31:00 a TI finals is proof his psychology is beyond everyone else's.
Everybody gangsta till they see Ceb holding a bunch of papers.
"These are the cinematics to look up for, like so everyone can see these masterpieces.

22:10 unkillable phoenix’s sun + kill
36:34 ceb’s call
37:50 the MEGAS
38:40 Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb!! (call of his lifetime)
52:34 ember+magnus playsss= bonus rosh
55:18 not a cinematic, but a beautiful fkng moment!!  (proud of da bois knowing what they went through)


i copied this from someone else's comment because it was way down and i just wanted to see it"
https://www.instagram.com/chemdofficial/
59:55 im not crying you're crying :')
Ceb carry them in game 4
"JerAx ""THE SAVIOR OF OG"""
"watched this soooo many times, beautiful movie."
"35:40
time traveler watching TI, look at that mask."
watching ti 2019 and 18 and just realize to win the game don't insult the enemy and enjoy the game
i cry watching this. gg
"12:43
LGD: teams that win game 1 always lose the finals.

OG: Not this time boyss"
This is pure inspiration. I come here so many time when Im losing my motivation. The hardest choice is the right choice.
"everytime i watch this i keep laughing at lgd fans saying ""go home  OG"
The difference  between hungry for winning and JUST PLAY WE DONT CARE IF WE WIN OR LOSE JUST PLAY.THIS IS THE BEST TEAM EVER CREATED AND WINNING AND DOTA HISTORY.THE HARDwork behind the scenes of a team before the champions .
Imagine if league of legends did this for worlds... It would be so boring.
Okay the announcer's voice at start gives me goosebumps.
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
I think at that time notail was celebrating. I think he wished that fly was there to enjoy the moment.
I don't know why I am watching again and again until 2020.
Нотэйл заслужил это
Jerax God
"Where’s Axe?lol ,like for Axe😂😂😂"
who is watching now ?
"Take your revenge on 2019

Engggggggggg NOPE 😂😂"
This series was so much better than TI9
"Anyone sees ana watching porn and he's tabbing his monitor to dota? Hahahaha
at early minute guys pay attention"
Why the fuck do I get  so emotional while watching this and I already watched this  truesight 20times
this is where his legendary story begins
Trash talk pa more tusk king
Go home og hahaha😂😂
Professional game face change from Jerax real quick 50:48-50:52
"R.I.P
TI10

YOU WILL BE REMEMBERED❤️"
"Fact: The main reason why EG and OG win a championship is because both of this team left by one of the important player on their roster. Funny thing is, it all circles around Arteezy. Arteezy left EG, EG won TI. Fly left OG for EG one thing is for sure, because of Arteezy. Who's is cursed now? I guess Arteezy himself but somehow he also brings luck to other teams. lol"
"3:47 if you notice here N0tail being an absolute amazing person, is trying to make an contact and convey his respect to LGD, but they are just ignoring him, you can see him smiling a bit, paying his respect."
Who here during the quarintine dont know what to do end up rewatching this again
12:42 gg
"The best TI in the
 history of dota2 <3 2020 #PEACE"

Ceb's like captain america. He gave so damn good speeches before going to a battle. A true great leader
Haha hoping chinese scrubs. Feeling pro and strong.. haha
Ceb is the Captain America of OG.

Ceb: today is our day
"I just play fucking League of Legends, but this team have something... i found out of their story a year ago and i cant stop following them since then."
the only Chinese Team i respect the most is Wings and its players
the only Chinese Team i respect the most is Wings and its players
"""i can't even see my hero"" -ana"
"after rewatching it many many times, i now realized how critical Jerax 's mind in reading the game and play making  also the ""man up"" moments. commanding the team to take decisive move. 

salute to this overall advanced  stategic thinker player"
Ti9 is more better than this
true sight is awesome but they missed out on some nice pivotal plays
"34:43 
Crowd: Go home OG
OG : Sure,we'll go as Champions 😂"
whats the name of song on 56:50
i just love how jerAx told them to fucking man up 52:05
"Both team have tears but diferent tears, one is tears of joy/happy and another is tears of sad/sorrow.."
"""This is my game boys"" how right he was..."
Somnus is dead inside
LGD toxic as fuck. Watching this 2020. Karma is real
The CCP virus brought me here.
27:17 the best confidence and trust
55:14
Game 4 of this TI is the most intense fight ever
"""F**cking man up"" always gets me"
Fy lookin like a fucking supervillain i love it
Goosebumps every time I watch this
Ceb is so good at motivating his teammates
"me on quarantine, playing dota & watching Truesight . 2020!"
Is topson legit? Ohhh if only they knew...
Ceeeeeeeeeeebbbbbbbb
"A wise man once said: ""Where's Axe?""lol"
Sing song
I don't know why but I keep watching this video again and again.
Love seeing those chinese shutting up their mouths and bow down their heads.
Those Chinese should be banned in real life
"Body: Time to sleep boy, it's already 5 am.

Youtube: Watch TRUE SIGHT: THE INTERNATIONALS 2018

When the two team passes each other it feels like WW3 gonna start
2:44 this is why I love Ana so much he is so oblivious all the time lmao
"China back then : GO HOME OG 

China now: WE HAVE NCOV"
"still gives me goosebump , i dont know how much i watched this , gg og"

"we won ti, what the fuck!!"
OG really stopped w33 and fy from winning TI's.

"SOMBONG SIH CINA, KALAH KAN LU WKWKWKW"
"How many people who shouted "" Go home OG"" and now become OG fans..??"
"Chinese: GO HOME OG!

Painful to watch

"The biggest question is:
Where's axe?"
"Jerax be like chill n0tail its just a game.

I also like how he laughs on cebs french gibberish"
"The Best TI final with The best True Sight ever. TI9 is a story of a team, proving that they are not just a fluke winner by demolishing every single team in the Tournament, by having fun ofc. But TI8 always give me goosebump. The production team amazingly capture the tension&emosion of every single moment. The way they believe in each other, not giving up, and always cheering for everybody. I like this documenter better than any other movie. Even though this is just a documenter, but the story just like unreal."
"I strongly believe that if i woke up in the morning, and i had to play the TI Final, i would play the best Dota of my life, and thats all that would matter to me. - To the bottom of my heart"
Man the trust og got for topson is legendary
59:47 nOtail truly deserves to he the two times champ.
"44:16
Ceb: together.
Topson: TOGETHER!
😂😂😂 THAT STILL MAKES ME LAUGH! 🤣🤣🤣"
the most biased audience: CHINESE
Walangsingsong kuwala ya wang wulu kye hua walang la wala

"28:52 Jerax to Ceb ""All trust on you man, easy."" What an awesome colleague.
28:56 Ceb ""This is my game boys."" then he proceed to get the call that change the game at 38:47. NOW THATS A FUCKING BOSS."
"*instrumental*
then goes ""I strongly believe that if I woke up...""
*goosebumps* always"
"No matter what countries you were from, all Dota 2 players share a same common. 
They say bad words. lol"
38:45 what just happened? Axe happened.
I need somebody like Ceb in my life.
The best one was TI2

Did anybody notice notail almost cry when they about to lose on game 5? (49:49)
"Damn, I still hate these goddamns bat eaters."
"Watching them play, I can't wait to play dota again with my friends."
31:00 my faveeee part ahaha
well i only learned this that playing dota 2 professionally WILL GIVE YOU LUNG CANCER
Who's still watching this form beginning until the end ? :')
"Anyone else notice that at the last second of game 5, n0tail tried to tp out?"
"The audience is loke ""aaaw china not numba wan.."""
"Honestly, the spirit to never give up is overwhelming in OG hearts even though they losing in the early game. It’s always different mentality with Chinese people. I don’t know why."
GOAT!
"i’ve been watching this more than 10 times alrd.
thats always make me crying when i watch this, i do love dota, i play it n learn it since i was young like 15 till now i hit 25 yo.
i didnt say im perfect alrd in this game even i have more than 8k mmr in the game, but i just want a opportunity to have a good teamates like this or any chance to play in big team because i never had any of it.
sometimes i blame myself bcs i born @ indonesia, in this country we have less respect to any player who play this game.
right now, i alrd leave dota for few months bcs my parents say i need to move on bcs my dota career doesnt going well..
but i still love dota, i still watchin this kind of games or replay video. if one day God has plans for me in this game, i think i will take it.
i just need some opportunity, to prove myself could do it.
atleast i can go hit the international camp, that will be my biggest target of my life.

notail and ceb, congratulation to both of you, u guys are the legend."
"I started playing Dota 2 maybe 2 weeks ago, and I am on a fucking marathon of watching these Dota videos - and this shit is sick."
Ceb's motivation is out of this world
"Go Home OG? 
Lul.
They went home, with the aegis."
7:15 music please?
JerAx is having so much fun this entire series <3
The best Ti finals so emotional. I really cry for happy every time I see it. I love Ceb really open mind and hype player.
Pls
"even though I watched up to 10x, my tears still fell while watching this"
59:24 n0tail 😭😭
Gets me everytime
"28:14 Tusk king my ass,Game 5 Global silence to Chinese fans🤣"
Best Game in History of Dota
"why ceb is my fav player, such outstanding leadership 48:26"
Go play crossfire china . Hahahahhah😂😂
"The next year from this TI8
Ana learn how more deadly in silent with carry position.
Topson learn how play with his next level play a.k.a new meta against ""lucky curse""
Ceb learn more dominating in lane against enemy carry.
Jerax learn how he can be more than magicial of position 4.
Notail learn what he believe about teammates trust since years ago will give him success.
And that's how they won TI9."
5:30 were they talking bout the cr1t incident?
go home OG u say? or go home LGD HAHAHAHA
Watching this during lockdown
Best T.I ever
"Started playing DOTA for a couple of months... While i agree it is a deeply engaging and entertaining game, the whole 'DOTA is life' movement is actually doing more bad than good. The DOTA community itself is very toxic. They don't get that it is NOT life. It is a VIDEO GAME. The way they abuse new players gives the idea that it might be a crime not to be good at the game. Among all the gaming communities I had the worst experience with this one. Try to promote fun rather than making it about life."
Watching this for the idk how many times
"fy:fucking hell they pick axe in front of tusk king....

2 games later

with flowers and friendship, ladies and gentlemen OG ARE YOUR TI8 GRAND CHAMPION."
I love how Notail and Ceb give their team the choice of hero ❣️
"""If I played with my very best, nothing else would matter"" -N0tail"
man I dont even play dota but I enjoy this movie so damn much lol
this is still the best true sight. i like how they portrayed LGD as the very competent antagonist. they just have this last boss vibe
"when i watch again , this chinese very racist !"
"Sad for the Chinese ppl early celebrate, now what happen 😂😂"
this LGD is very arrogant team hate them 😠😠😠
"""GO HOME OG!""


OG: Gladly With the aegis in our hands"
At 2:56 what meds somnus taking?

They deserve this Ti8
Man watching those chinese fans cry feels so good
"LMAO... sir OG are spamm chatting us , then lets ignore them...block the user .... but what if they call GG and we dont see it ?! HMMM"
"бля, как же они ахуенно курят"
"39:15 A Legendary carry once said that ""I mean i don't really know wtf is going on i can't even seen my own heroes"""
"""Go Fucking Ember, i trust your Fucking Ember"" yo this is fuckin gold man everytime i watch this i fuckin repeat that phrase"
"""all they want to do is defend and hold"" .. with a spectre? you dont say...."
37:29
"""Holy crap, Ceb is holding a bunch of papers."""
"PH President : Everyone should be safe and must stay in their homes.

Me: Ok it's time to watch true sight ti8 over and over again."
Am I the only one who's gonna comment on how the chineses are boastful XD lakad matatag
I think I've seen this 4 or 5 times at this point
power of lakad matatag
Actually OG have the greatest minds in dota 2 cause they do things seems impossible then prove everyones worth
holy crap! this OG give me goosebumps and make my tears fall unexpectedly because of that call from ceb. What a play specially in the game 4. Congratulations to all of you for the achievement and I won't ever forget the spectacular games you all show to the world of dota 2. We love you guys
Ceb: This is my game man..
can't wait for the next TI but now we had to deal with this corona shit
"37:16 jerax relocating ana and telling him if he wants to go back  and said ""memes""

ana was like ""fuck off"" and jerax saying ""byebye"" 😂😂"
55:03 man i felt xnova's pain 😭
PSG LGD is so full of themselves thats why this happened to them
Every time im down i always watch this. It cheers me up i hope i can find a friend like ceb who never gave up on you.
Corona fights back for china
Feels emotional for OG while watching ... Still feels good

This is the most beautiful finals that has ever happened in the history of dota.
The best TI eveeer. Hello there quarantine people! Stay safe.
"when Jerax says "" Ana you're so fucking good!"".. that's the moment ana gets his Dota God Status.. lol"
Best true sight ever maded
OG is the best teamwork in dota2
Give me chills. Very confident 14:44
"To this day, I find it emotionally happy for Notail for winning this particular Ti. He deserved this more than anybody to prove his believe."
"If OG can defeat the Chinese, we can defeat Corona.

Stay strong!"
Hey OG I'm watching this game from future congratulations guys you won ti9 😌
Watching this back really gives me the chill. THE EMOTIONS MAN.
14:50 the chinese guy: why am I here for let me speak bro.
9:44 the chinese guy: let me see dude. LGD didnt respect the line up of OG. They expect more professional game play but Og give them an amateur game play they cant read OG's moves thats why they lose.
Stay save in home and watch TI8 & TI9 and dont cry🙏🏻
Arrogance as its finest.
The BEST TI of all time !
"The look on ppasarel's face at 11:35. I can't be more happy for him. He's a fellow romanian and I have been watching him since dota 1. I remember playing in the internet cafe and I had no clue what I was doing but I was so fascinated with the game and the whole mechanics. He is on of the pillars that created my love for this game. You can't even understand how happy I am for this guy. I had to write this just so I can express myself. Maybe some of my romanian gamers out there will read this and relate aswell. I hope we will overcome this virus that is haunting our whole planet and watch many more internationals, because I honestly need more.


I hope that my rambling will touch a couple of you guys and make you feel the way I that I feel right now.


Peace out for the community!"
2:44 WHAT WAS ANA WATCHING? TWITCH DOTA2?
Am I the only one who thinks OG's coach looks like Ribery from FC Bayern Munich?
"Commentator (2018): “FY has been the magician of position 4.”

Jerax (2019): Tiny Airlines boys"
ANA did that =)
I've watch this many times and still  cry....
Jerax is leaving? :(
"Didnt even realize that this TI is for OG's new members, specifically Game 4"
This Ti8 is the best game in finals haha its so funny beacause lgd muted og haha i watch this kver and over again
Oh my god I mean their team vibe is amazing ❤️ Worthy of being the holders of Aegis totally ❤️
Corona virus spreader
Кто играет из 2013 ставте палец!
OG's friendship is something you can never beat. I can still remember betting so much in this TI for OG despite people saying theyre gonna lose 💗🌻
"Three straight TI's not for China

"38:39 *Where's Axe?*

38:38
Still gives me chills
57:40 Didn he just cheer for Chuan as well? :D

Jerax is actually really fucking good. If you listen to him in the background he pretty much always tells his team when its good to man up
"Anyone knows what ""oppa oppa"" means and what oanguage is it?"
35:57 best climax intro
when your T.T. turns you down... GO HOME OG :D
"""lets mute them.""
""Ill mute them once we're in game.""

Jerax the God of memes and trolls.

56:11 Look at notail. Man the emotions... Hes been through alot and he really deserves this TI
"12:43 Teams that win game 1 always lose  the finals.

it's not always like that bro."
whats the prize for runner up? is it money or what?
"I LIKED TOPSON SO MUCH, SILENT BUT DEADLY!!!"
不是幽鬼厉害，而是ANA的幽鬼厉害，ANA的中后期控场和打架能力目前真的是Dota界第一，无出其右的。
Hahaha ako lang ba yung naka quarqntine kaya nanunuod ngayon ✌🥰🤘
"Ceb's been boosting their mentality all series long, helping them believe that they're better, encouraging them that they have what it takes to win the biggest tournament in E-sports history. Yet when they won Ceb was the only one collapsing with tears of joy, relief, and happiness that they had done it, he literally put all the pressure on him. Respect"

Still the best true sight
If u guys remembered kiev major back in 2017. U will see how ceb motivates OG when he was a coach. Damn this guy so smart!

38:42 Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
"Notail : What are you feeling the most ?
Topson: I dooooonnnnnnnuuuuu
Ceb: Whatever it is we gonna slay with it.
Topson: ahmmm Zeuss ?
And Zeus it is. Thats friendship and Trust. Thats what OG is."
Lol this ti 8 is more epic and emotional than ti 9 🤣
what was somnus poppin before game 1
"36:55 , the moment Notail know that there is a chance to win the game"
"Ceb like a father in OG and n0tail is older child . I see same aura in Ceb and kuro , they like a father in their team , they more than a leader (i know if n0tail is the captain) but I see if Ceb do more from like captain . But now we lose one of the greatest leader."
Players like lgd doesn't deserve the Agies
Watching this remind me how bad liquid strat are
"you gonna see some shit guys..     

ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb"
music starting 41:00 ???
TI8 is the best and most thrilling TI ever
Just came here for 38:47
Oppa oppa boys!!!!!!!
Minghoy mga pikot oy haha
2020 and still laughing bout the Tusk King
38:49 Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
in your face china
"""yeah, this might be the axe game"""
Ceb is a fucking castle. holy sh**t
It's all fun and games until the EU team starts speaking their native language
"12:41 oopsss that does not apply to you , but it apply to nigma :)"
I love how OG taught those guys a lesson of humility
it's already 2020 but WTF is that? 52:13
Where are you now haters of OG??...hahahaha
The best TI finals ever
54:00 Is that Kaci with the crowd? been watching this for many times and this is the first time that I saw her haha
"Notail a.k.a Narutail , never give up and never take his word back ! 2x TI champion , u deserve it man."
that analyst in the middle has no clue what's going on
Did you know that the fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea?
"37:28 Jerax: Ana you wanna relo into the base? Memes. 
HAHAHAHAHAAHAHA I fucking love this guy joking around even with a hard game"
TI 8 true sight > TI 9 true sight
Who think true sight ti8 much better than ti9?
"Ti8 they call him Dogson
TI9 THEY CALL HIM GODSON"
Never underestimate your enemy rofl
that reaction of the minute 55:13 says everything
41:50 me after watching this vid
"Still crying in happiness ..2020
Godbless you always OG !! .."
I really think Someone Should make a movie on OG before during and after TI8 In a way to show those who dont play dota to understand the story cauae its just beautiful and it hurts that their story cant be shared properly like put this up so they see
Should have been OG vs LGD in TI9. Team Liquid did nothing in the finals.
"Anybody 58:47 : Take your Revenge Next Year
OG : Nope"
The Chinese are so racist! Only the Chinese can play in their teams.
Watching this make me realize this game is not for indonesian (in competitive scene). Keep playing mobile legends fellow SEA people! 🤣
Ti8 > Ti9
i will destroy him - ceeeeeb
29:50 i kept on replaying that clip
"""Give the boy Invoker"" said the guy who just won ti back to back"
Ana (tips):the enemy can't know where your hero is if you dont know where your hero is
"man , Ceb is just an extra ordinary person ... this man can become the next jurgen klopp if he become head coach of football team ....

his leadership is fucking awesome

i can feel it even iam not in there .."
Best true sight ever
power of smoke break
"18:40 
So, you see, that’s where the trouble began.
That smile. That damn smile."
Not a dota related topic but what brand of  sweatpants is notail wearing?
Remembering how i used to play with my friends. Fuck. Goodtimes. 😭 I cry. Repeated this and ti9 true sight. Damn. I miss my old friend in dota.
Ceb and NoTail needing to sit after winning is so cute what a touching moment ❤️
51:19 ....... Replay error with TB attacking at range in melle form. lel
the chinese got really cocky
"Jerax : Ana do u wanna relo on base? memes...
Ana: fuck off."
and now theyre spreading corona virus
"Arrogance LGD,  not educated LGD fans"
"I comeback to this after watched TI9 
So from now on it's different lineup but I still looking for OG 's og style play"
JerAx used to be so happy playing...
"After watched it full, somehow i feel like the TI8 is really chose the right winner. Not because of how they play, but because of the mental winning attitudes. They take it seriously but fun and yet strong to the point of nothing to lose, but the other team already looked down on them, and underestimated them from the start. Acting like they already won and thinked already done whooped enemy ass. And even still thinked like that after the first lose.
But the destroyed throne make up the reality. 
I feels like they literally picked silencer to silence them shelves and it nicely done.

Last team standing laughed the most."
"This truesight teach me something.

Dont be bothered by the enemy team even if the were laughing,smiling or looking at some papers.

You keep focusing on you team,and not the enemy."
"You can see the difference between Team liquid and Team OG, kuroky lift the aegis trophy and hold it all the time(TI7 true sight), Team OG was sharing the trophy to all the members."
58:46 hahahahahaha next yr? hahahahah
too bad they didnt show gameplay moments - there were so many amazing plays and comebacks (TrueSight '19 is much better in this regard)
Topson before he got his million dollar
tusk king is no match for an AXE
Still the best ti for me.
el sueno de todo serrano :Cc
"Who's here after watching the ti9 true sight? Haha OG The Best! Thankyou Cebb, jerrax, and ana! Hope u will comeback Ti10! 😞"
who is here for corona virus?
I came here for this 49:47 😂😂😂
"Ceb is holding crap paper...
Result:ti 18 campion"
"52:51 - JerAx almost cried, and so did I xD"
Кто тут после просмотра про 19 год ?)
Somnus so fuckin ugly
"When they chant go home og and it is still half the vidz duration

Boy this going to be fun"
"I just started playing dota last year and TI9 and THE true sight was amazing, i just watch it and this is beautiful man im crying"
Who’s here after watching the TI10 truesight?
coronavirus spreading motherfuckers
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBBB!!!!!
Ceb is the best motivator in OG
when you notice everything is bath in green
"This was the best TI. Period. 2nd is TI3 (million dollar dream coil is still one of the greatest single plays in Dota history), TI9 might be 3rd but not because of the finals but because there was literally no game in the bracket stage that really sucked and all teams were really innovative.
But TI8 had everything. Drama, a Cinderella story and a final that kept you on edge till the very last moment. The best Phoenix performance (fy) and the best Axe performance (Ceb) and goddammit, Ana redefined stable carry play that TI, that guy was just insane (same in TI9 though, just amazing)."
THIS ASS IS LOOKING AT HIS LITTLE NOTES AGAIN!
may i know the opening background music of this?
"LGD was so toxic towards eachother tbh, especially Chalice"
Valve really improved with the TI9 True Sight. Is so much better cut and edited.
"LGD, toxic fully disrespect team deserved this. Never trashtalk your opponent before you actually won!"
Sad that we will never see this OG roster again 😭
This intro... Still gives me a goosebumps
"Imagine not knowing the outcome of the finals, but game 3 just ended and youre not even half way through the video. Ohnononono"
Watching this after true sight 2019 😝
crying always on the game and then throw the game stupid chinesw
49-8 bois
"Whose watching this after True sight 2019  and crying everytime Jerax comes onscreen ? 
(and also realizing bananas are key to OG strats)"
Coming back here again after watching true sight 2019
"LGD 2018: «Teams who won game 1 lose finals» 
Liquid 2019:"
That Echo Slam when Rosh dies. Somnus got stunned 😂
best TI i ever watched . up to date
38:40 - I still got teary everytime. CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB!
Psg so fucking cocky
Notail and Ceb really have Positives Mental Attitude
中国选手一有画面就满嘴脏话，口头禅也就算了，这傻逼，那傻逼，对手都是傻逼。你以为你在匹配路人？
"Chinese, the Coronavirus spreaders and the worst audience ever. Cyka blyat."
2019 True Sight is better than this. The Camera exchange is bad in this game. They focus on the commentator and audience rather than the players and team fights. So fckng annoying.
LGD gave OG a much harder time than Liquid in TI finals
"PLEASE,WHAT S THE SONGS NAME THA STARTS AT 7:15 pls!!!"
Who's here after watching TI9 truesight? 2019
All the critical moments have JerAx written all over them... You'll be missed!
52:52 what did noTail scream ???
8:36 That man is hot <3
BEST TI FINAL EVER
PSG Mental down so fcking nub
"Ame: Where is the axe?
Ceeeeeeeeeeb."
at 55:40 thats me every new year 😂
best true sight
Legends says Ana is still looking for his hero 39:17
心疼fy啊
"Topson got a lot of experience in this Ti8, 
Ti9 topson is just insane compared to Ti8 Topson"
5:46 xD
This is the best true sight.
"37:30

JerAx: ana u wanna relo in the base? 
ana: No, no, no, no
JerAx: Memes?
ana: Fuck off

What a legend. Bye JerAx"
Their faces when Axe comes online. o_o

55:37
"Who watch this hours before the True Sight of TI9, announcement of JerAx retiring from the pro scene, ana taking another year of rest, and Ceb stepping down as a player."

"8 hrs to go, ti9 truesight premiere. Kaway kaway sa mga pinoy"

"""They're attacking highground guys. They have a really big problem. PL lvl 25 guys"""
"topson is so shit in this TI like wtf, always carried by his team. but he improve a lot in TI9, gotta admit it."
"This is make me cry, no matter how much i rewatch this one..."
Warm up for ts 2019
38:40

Watching it today before the premiere of TI9 True Sight
Ceb cursing in French is so sexy.
9:44 reaction i play pusher no one help me push 😭😭😭 pak
Let us watch it again before the new true sight comes. All hail OG 💙💚
What music did they use in this documentary???????????
Soon Ti9 truesight will be available to watch. I’m super happy and feel alive. Love OG forever. Sad they r disbanded.
"Firstly we lost ana, then jerax finished hei career and now CEB. But the story of their lifetime will be remembered for all the time"
55:12 chills
"What the fuck ana ur so cute
-jerax"
Still Chinese people is the worst crowd/audience.
"Og: they acc dont know what to pick. Theyre fucked
40 min later....
Og: gg? looks like it. next game boys"
Damn Ill miss Jerax so much. Hes support is so genius
"Guys, true sight TI9 is coming tomorrow!"
Rewatching while waiting for TI9 True Sight
Who’s watching this the day before TI9 release?
"Lgd:Teams that win first game will lose  the finals
Og:what??"
41:48 :') my eyes cant take it
Can't wait tomorrow truesight
back after JerAx announce his retirement.. :(
35:43 n0tail buying time with his life :(
5:31 Is he referring to the shoulder that Crit bumped? I dunno if you guys remember that
who is here after jerax announced his retirement today?
"The crowd who yelling ""go home og"" its crying forever"
Who went here because Jerax retired?
55:36 Happy chinese new year guys
"Still good to hear ""Lakad matatag"" again and again"
Ahh man. The satisfaction looking at the face of chinese fans are priceless.
Coronavirus spreaders 😂😂😂
"55:12, look at notail's face like: ""it's really happening, oh my god"" and this epic announcement of TI8 champion at 55:17"
game 4 ... CEB really holding onto his words...one call can changed everything
GO HOME OG HAHAAAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
rewatched to hype myself for incoming ti9 true sight.
I love Ceb a lot
Did Ame ever spoke?
Gonna watch this until they premier TI9 true sight on Jan 28!
40:20 the moment Jerax know they're gonna win
54:49 trash talk boi gets fuckd in the brain :)))
30:59
🖤🖤
0:48 intro ??
"just rewatched it, the tears."
My New Year 55:36
"n0tail ; You guys realize , I hit 15 000 hours of Dota during this final.
Ceb; What a way to hit it.
n0tail ; 15000 hours , whatever they have , whatever they have, I have more than them .

Said from a 2 times TI champions captain that win back to back ."
shout out to the edit though
Sombong membawa petaka
Im crying...
Can anyone who understand Chinese tell me what the fuck lgd says about the hero names. I mean they say soo many hero names and I don't even hear any sound similar to the actual hero names. The only name I understood was lich in ti7 trusight snd kunkka
Notail said POTA
"The LGD's problem is focusing on what their opponents doing, instead of focusing  on their strats"
What's they talking 12.32
Damn these cigarette ads are getting better.
Man that last part of the Video is so inspiring
24:45 The Interstellar intensifies. So good.
"que mal , esos OG Son re creidos, me caen mal."
This Optic Gaming team is not bad.
Watching this again gives me chill n goosebumps so freaking hard.. too many lesson from ceb and way too much fun from OG.. 45:28 slark? hehehh...
"""No matter what it is we're gonna destroy them with it""
-Ceb"
Notail gasping for air before winning is still giving me chills...
"""Go home OG"". They sure as hell did with the aegis that is"
Watching this again I realized how heartbreaking it is seeing lgd players in silence after the finals. Especially somnus and fy. They were the best team that dpc season and only one step away from winning. Even notail said it was really hard to watch when they watched the true sight
"5 Majoг, 2 TI, 3 Tгue sight they aгe Tгue legends"
Ame speaks only 1 time whole video :D
these guys deserve to win so bad
12:42 Unforgettable
31:44 Bulldog
Ok tomorrow is 15th January it means true sight of ti9 is gonna release
when will the ti9 truesight come out? been 13 times im watching ti8 😂
The Chinese face like this 😔☹️
"What part time job can pay you millions?

Ana: uhm"
"Ceb said "" dont worry boys, this is my game!"" 
""I'll destroy him💪""
Then ceeeeb totally destroy them❤️"
its a true true sight...u see how the teams counter each other in the game and mentally..like picking heroes the other team tells but the other ban it without hearing anything about the other...like centaur suggest centaur ban...ceb tells their stats about giving somnus good game and 147 said zeus??batrider kunkka in game 5...its jus all true sight and gods plan and the true one wins it....;D
why this cinese are so rude and racist ?? always underestimated opponent ?? lol .. fuck them
"Everyone: ""To be silent but deadly like topson""

Topson: ""RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!"""
"38:27 ODpixel be like ""No Homo"""
"Encontre los sonundtrans del minuto 30:30 en aca, tambien estan los demas soundtranks solo se deben buscar https://audio.alibimusiclibrary.com/#!project?projectId=905086"
Still watching. Still the best ti championship ever
"""ana u want banana?"""
GG for OG
"Most of people don't realize that game 4 had a bug in it. When Morph used to level up as PL, he didn't gain stats. And bc of that, morph lost a lot of agility, and probably it played a big role in this game. Bug got fixed right after the Ti8"
"""Do you want to play Invoker ? ""
"" Get him Invoker ""
This is why OG won TI.
They respect and trust their teammates."
Me every time back from work 41:50
"Jerax does so much so fucking much, he is a silent killer and Anna man a beast!"
"If anyone ever want to make a movie about gamer, this is some Oscar material right here."
the best true sight and the best ti. teared up everytime when they all scream at the end
bobo support walang ward
"4:20 - 5:30

Почему не вставили в колесо чата:опа опа бойз?)
"Top 10 moments before disaster:
""Where's axe?"""
24:24 Is that a NO SMOKING Sign and I see Notail with a cigarette right in front of it.
Anyone notice Notail smoking in no smoking zone....
Go home u china
2020?
I never though this video would be so beautiful.😍 can't wait for another one
what if they gg and we missed it. hahaha lol as if
The one thing I like in OG is they let their player decide which heroes their gona use. If they feel the hero they pick it without second thought.
"“How can they pick axe against the tusk king”
3 seconds later...


CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB"
"Ceb: Topias Zeus, Ana Ember
n0tail: *wimps* Johan Prophet anybody? he he he"
Let FY be leader and coach
"Still the best documentary ever, and i think i will come back to this after i watch True Sight TI9 and still say 'This was better'"
55:36 the face you make when you celebrate new year at 2020 after losing a game in dota 2.
"It's funny here
2018 give this boy invoker
2019 tidehunter mid"
"Wise man once said ""Chi** C****"""
"""take you revenge next Year"" kappa"
"Here we go again boiz, rewatching OG's wtf run at TI8. It's that time of the year again."
Это лучший фильм в моей жизни. Плакал в конце как тварь
watching while waiting for true sight 2019.
Why tf is this an hour long?
"i feel for the chinese fans, this is how ill feel when a non-EU team wins TI10."
"nunca en español, ni siquiera los subtitulos, que les vale mierda la comunidad de Dota2 de latinoamerica."
The Chinese guys were so weak mind in this match
Iiterally me at newyear
For Hong Kong!
"Random Chinese Crowd : Take your revenge next year!
LGD 2019 : TOP 3🤣"
Where are spanish titles?!
"“Mute them” “block the user” 
Really shows how OG gets into people’s heads."
"38:30

The most epic dota moment after the 1mil echoslam"
"Teams that win the first game also lose.
Team Liquid ""are we a joke to you?"""
26:02 wtf Jakiro
READY FOR TI9 TRUE SIGHT 🔥
"Ceb in 2018: It's been too easy so far, we knew we'd get tested

In 2019: Well damn, this is really fuckin EZ"
LGD here in 2018 has no idea what a monster team they made OG into by giving them shit for turtling strategy. 2019 OG went in a complete different direction with constant aggression and pressure. Top teams simply melted before OG's pace
TOPSON's Reaction at 37:54

"After watching this I really respect OGs spirit, but I also feel so bad for LGD.
They also tried their best, maybe played this game from Dota1 and he is once the best midlaner I can remember.
It’s just a time has passed. And we all grew old.

Glad to see each TI though, best game in the world."
still no truesight ti9?
Why is that there is no true sight in ti9?

What does he mean? I read that Axe is called something else, but the translation says that he is saying ""AXE AXE AXE!""
To me it sounds like the sound Anti-Mage makes when he slice people. VUV VUV VUV"

"My two personal favorite moments were:
Ceb: ""I want to play. Play play play, play dota""
Jerax: ""Ana you wanna relo into their base? Memes? :D""

Just a team of friends with complete faith in each other, holding each other up, and most importantly, love to have fun in the game."
"No matter how many times I watched this, it always make me cry a little in the end. Just look at Notail and Ceb's expression after they realized they won TI. Even they can't believe it themselves. What a journey, and what a win. Congrats, Legends."
Bad attitudes deserves a lose

funniest $h1t ever.. and if this doesn't define Jerax not sure what does
Jerax: Ana, Wanna relo into their base, memes? *evil grin*
Ana: Fck off"
"I just want to know who from OG actually has the eyes to scout and recruit players?  in 3 years they have found Miracle, Topson and Ana** (although IG saw him first) and resurrected Ceb's career as a player."
"Am I the only one here who never played DOTA (or any games like this)? I mean, I really love watching these videos after (accidentally) watching *OG's comeback to win DOTA 2's TI8 | Against The Odds*. Man! I am not really sure how to explain."
Please just make true sight ti9. Please. Pleasseeeeee!!
Ti8 dogson TI9 godson

That sigh from n0tail at 55:12 always gives me the chills. Look at his face. Almost crying. He can't believe they're actually doing it.

Cinderella story has no better than this
Almost every sentence tat LGD said is accompanied with curse words... The translations ain't putting them in..
"It's all about your teammates. Strong will, trust and breakdown the ego and individuality. This what makes OG win the TI 2 times. Thanks for OG for making TI more colorful ! 🙌"
"25%best plan  Notail
 15% best supportfull   Ceb
 15%  pro mid topson
 15% best in smiling Jerax
 30% best comebacker Ana"
true sight ti9 pls
Valve GIVE 2019 TRUE SIGHT PLZ
"I wish to become friend with ceb. He is pure. i think its better not to put eng subtitles when chinese people talks. They even judge ogs action in ban picks momment, they even say teams that win in game 1 always lose in finals.
picking axe in front of tusk king? is the translations correctly? if yes i want to see their conversation faces reactions after they lost finals. Shameful truth that chinese always claming something that they dont own."
Finally true sight no English subtitles lol
Damn it to wait till January for the next one is fucking killing me
Hhahahh
Eyyyyy
"Fuck, Ceb’s “I want to play” scene always gets me"
Where's pasarel?

What's the title of a track on 7:20 moment?
This year got stil got true sight?
Чччччееееемпээээонннн
"Man, it's hard to find friend like Ceb nowaday.."
"All OG WINS
OG wins on manila major 2016
OG wins on Kiev major 2016 or 2017
OG WINS ON TI8 Champions
OG wins on ti9 champions"
Why I have goosies in 41:44. Man it chills me. I feel some type of way I can't understand 😢
"""One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful."""
"fy: ""they dare to pick axe in front of tusk king"", bro OG are the kings of dota, they do whatever they like and in the end they will still thrash you"
og's creative draft > draft a normal line up 43:35
55:36 so sad fy

the best true sight i never seen
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEb
why there’s still no true sight for ti9
Chinese global silence
Notail should change his nickname to Jotail so everyone on OG have their nickname based on real name
I’m still getting goosebumps man!!! Ahhhhhhh
"52:50 all dat emotion. Ana: ""Wooo"""
Lgd is pure trash talk
"""Ceb it's real. Come on, Ceb! It's real!!!"" oh man gets me every time."
Their motivation and bond wins them 2 years of TI
"57:43 i don't get what he says...it sounds like chuan, but what does chuan has to do with that?"
"37:28 - Man I love JerAx no homo.
39:16 - OG in a TI finals is still hilarious."
Best truesight so far !
"Comeback here for waited true sight ti9, i want to knew what og talks after lose game 1"
"Ti8 true sight is a joyful to watch, nice storytelling, fun and positive between the rush and fast game. Its refreshing. Waiting for ti9"
Still waiting for TI9  True Sight....
"Notail : TI brings the best and worse in you 
30:58 : the real ceb 😂"
What did notail said after ceb’s “on est sur les nerfs” ? The exact words and translation
Damn that feels on the outro. Watching this after ti9. Johan u fucking legend
I want to see the true sight when og vs eg in ti 9
"Что б вы понимали на сколько OG доверяют друг другу , где то на 30:15 акс ультует, зная что не убьет, но надеясь на топиаса. Поверьте, в обычной тиме вы такого бы не увидели от напряжения и давления."
"Dota Community Presents You - ""MASTERPIECE""..."
Now people are waiting ti9 true sight
Waiting for true sight TI9
Ultimate satisfaction on the chinese audience faces <3
"help me find the song of the minute 7:14 please, I beg you, someone help me.
I want to die in peace :,3"
"Actually the reason OG won the TI8 is in 11:45 
Look at Ceb, that’s the secret, its potasium guys"
41:32 bad move. you don't play the blame game during crucial moments.
Og is full of positivity they just risk the pick to make thier member comfortable with their hero BROTHERHOOD
37:55 thank me later
Still here waiting for the True sight TI9 :D
1.4k Chinese dislikes lol
"lgd has nothing to be sad about this series. look at the fans man, look at them. god damn. i wish i was able to watch this live or in live stream at that time. such a wonderful sight. glad im alive in this timeline"
38:45 you're welcome
invoker is a pig? i thinks what he's trying to say is invoker is pretty fed
Small youtuber here please

Crowd? CeBayed
Hahahahaha it's funny that chinese team really think they can win against OG.
52:56 TATATAT
OG ti9 true sight cant wait for that
No ti9 truesight?
I really think valve themselves can make a movie if they really wanted to
"now these is a real esports. let them scream, curse at each other. there's a reason it's called competitive."

31:05 Jerax laughing at all the french swearing in a high pressure environment is me everyday with my repsonsibilities
"When we humble defeat,victory is just an option."
"Jerax deserves more credit, he was like the captain during the games specially game 5"
aw sht here we go again
"""Johan, Prophet, anybody?""
Absolutely sir"
55:13 notail forgot to brethe...
"The passion both teams show is amazing & inspiring, I am so happy for OG after all they went through and respect to both teams as they really put on a show for the ages that dota fans everywhere will never forget! Congrats to OG on winning B2B TI Titles! They deserve it!"
"TI10, what will we ban? Let's ban OG first"
straight anime shits up in here
"Notail: Dota is  a sick mental game.. 
While  ML?"
"One of the reasons they've won is the attitude @52:12 ""Guys, win or lose, we don't care, we play."" That makes a lot difference because it can make you tilt proof and stay focused. I like how Ceb and Notail cheer their team members and keep them focused."
if you have good ears you can clearly hear Lakad Matatag at 30:39
"Two curse break by OG
East and West curse
and Winner curse"
Ceb is a really good leader. They could've won without him.
5:51 i always laugh with this moment. 😁
late game scares everyone
"and OG break the cycle of TI winners and be the first back2back TI winners, while meme-ing the competition with mindgames strange picks and builds"
"1997: Harry Potter, the boy who live
50:44 He's alive"
"i really need True Sight TI9, i cant wait any longer..."
"Go home OG!!
Oh wait the chinas just big mouth now they quiet"
im here waiting for the ti9 true sight :D
"Chinese chanting ""Go Home OG"" then Ti9 come they are been fucked up on there HOME LOL CHINA PEOPLE LOL"

FY IS A GOD! GOD OF JOKES! HAHAHAHA then he cryyy lol
Been watching this for almost 10times still not bored of it.
The power of friendship
55:14 Ti18 champions!!!!!! Og my god im cry😭
i wish i could really play like them. they are really good at playing dota :(
Still waiting for TI true sight wherein both teams speak english(ehm TI9 please)
46:42 китайский ХВОСТ в посередине
38:45 the moment that gave me the one of the greatest chill of my life
"after watching this, i am more convinced now that OG really deserved to win the TI twice cause their players are very trusting and positive among each other plus they do not blamed each other even they lost. This is the perfect example of positive mental attitude that all players need when playing dota."
True sight ti9 please :')
"""Ana you wanna relo to base?""
""Meme?""
""Fuck off""

_meanwhile in ti9_
*FOUNTAIN FARMING*"
True sight ti9 and another true sight focusing og hardship. We still waiting for it. Btw rtz still farming until today.
What if see them call GG? Lol loser chingchonsgs
"Fy : who the hell are they? Picking axe in front of tusk king?
Ceb : im ti8 champions 😁"
"What language did ceb says to notail ""we're are on edge!""?
40:05"
Can anyone help me find the music that starts at 41:20?
Does anyknow the piano played in 41:50
"idk, this documentary has everything. it shows OG's Joy of winning, but it shows the desperate feeling of losing from LGD. Look at Fy tho, he is so damn sad. I do can feel what he felt. Goddamn, i'm Crying beause of happy for OG and Sad for LGD. LGD is very fucking strong team. Dominating every fucking single lane. But, OG manage to win because they play with their heart. This documentary so fucking awesome."
You know what's hard? Going against someone who think he has nothing to lose.
OG's mentality is so fun to watch.  LGD was terrible.
Ban it.
i dont know why but this film gives me goosebumps...
They are all gods
14:44 KUN KAAAAHHH
Tusk king my ass
3:45 Notail try smile to them :(
TI9 True Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight I can wait but lord gimme patience
"Last year OG won 3:2, this year they won 3:1, next year it's time for a clean swipe 3:0!"
Chinese mofos looking smug af until they got smoked hahahahaha
The chinese crowd really support OG.They're supporting OG to go home with the aegis just great.
"ana: nice.
n0tail: nICE!!!!
ceb: very nice

XD"
Notail and Ceb's pep-talk... This is a perfect example of a team..
"GODson:  I really like Invoker
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB: GIVE THE BOIZ INVOKER !!!!!!!!!!!!"
"28:04 ""Ceb Axe monkaS""

Ana LMAO"
"OG, the unpredictable team."
"38:39 where's axe?  






38:48 CEEEEEEEB!"
28:06 Ceb was so damn right about that Axe play
So emotional
"[TI8] The problem with LGD Team is they are more focused on what hero they will pick and what the opponents will pick, unlike with OG Team, they are more focus on the game play they need to do (PLAN) and how they execute that. I'm not pro player by the way, but this is just my opinion."
Ceb it's real. Ceb it's real. That was heartwarming
55:13 - that face always gives me shivers
"มองหาคอมเม้นไทย? อยู่นี่ไง!! ทั้งเพลงทั้งการตัดต่อ โคตรพ่อโคตรแม่ดีตั้งแต่เริ่มยันจบ เพลงเหมือนกำลังจะเริ่มสงคราม,เริ่มสงคราม,จบสงคราม ละเติมเพลงสิ้นหวังลงเล็กน้อย ตบด้วยคำพูดย้อนหลังเท่ๆ โคตรดีย์ ปะ! เล่นดอทกัน"
"I can watch this like more than 10000 times, this is so fcking good."
Go home lgd lol
"Topson on TI8: I'm Dogson guys
Topson on TI9: I'm the one and only Godson. The multiple times improved Topson you underestimated."
"Ceb has: Words of wisdom, Strategy, Acceptance, Motivation, Positivity, and a fighting spirit."
"Nobody: 
JerAx: Ceb Treant. We won?
TI8: Yes
Dota 2:
Gabe Newell:
eSports:"
At 52:52 everyone is screaming and Jerax looks like he is about to cry but hold up his tears. 😭
"Man, the team work
the friendship
the trust 
OG is just so fucking beautiful!!"
what sup Tusk king lol
"PSG.LGD: “Let’s mute them.”
It just shows how OG can break other teams mentally. Showing off emotes when they lose fights, adding insult to injury. Sometimes it is disrespectful to other teams but it is their strategy and I love that, it makes other players tilt through the whole game."
True sight ti9 grand final pls
true sight 2019 plsssss!!!
And they win again
This one is my favorite because everytime I watch this it motivates me to play even more :)))
i rly dont get why lgd ban ES. also 2 time champs OG wooooooooooooooo
"Rewatching this after ti9! I CANT WAIT for the next true sight to come out! So beautifully made , another ti for OG :)"
"Proud of OG for winning TI8 against all odds and even prouder of them for winning TI9, proving that they didn't just get lucky.

Go OG! Lakad Matatag!"
When you said topson never win any match but now he destroy every mid😂😂
55:45 his face tho. All talk pffft
37:57 Junnieboy dissapointed.
"Ceb: topias zeus, ana ember
Notail: johan prophet anybody?
Ana: johan prophet, jesse rubick

49:47 🤣🤣🤣 i can't have enough of this, they still enjoy the game tho"
Why the hell I'm crying?

Get rekt bitcheeeeeeeeeez
"Topson to Godson
It’s been awhile 
Waiting for ti9 true sight"
SEE YA'LL GUYS IN 2020 <3
Next year will be our year
"Nice comments everyone, but could anyone tell me what the music at 7:14 is? Really bad ass."
Why do i feel like OG is the good and PSG is the bad..like movie
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBB!!!!
Who is the guy in the booth behind the players?
"that gasp @55:14 was the Best feeling for anyone ...? who have dreams and dreaming for it for so much time ,,,"
Ti9 true sight pls
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
"When the small deal becomes BIG DEAL. That's Topson. No, GODSON!"
"No matter how many times I look at this, chinese players were so fckin Arrogant. Im thankful they didnt win. Plus 2 times in a row 😂(Slap on their face)"
PSG LGD's players are so dam rude
"""This might be the axe game, youre gonna see some shit man""

-ceeeeeeb"
"37:28 Jerax : 'Ana you want to relocate to base. Memes' 

Ana : 'Fcck off'

Jerax : 'Bye bye' 🤣🤣🤣"
"Lose together, win together, slay together slay together slay together."
Ceb is a genius and a great motivator

Lakad matatag
Chinese are so disrespectful.
54:47 look at that sad face.
Great production quality
"Interviewer: Who was there for you ?
N0tail: All six of them ... all six of them."
Can't wait for ti9 true sight
"i just think both teams are great !!!
 they both has something we don't have 
 and even camera can't show it 
 
 例えば1試合目負けた時の切り替えや！　
　素直に叫べる時の嬉しさとかね、
　これだから見られずにいられない！
　ただ単に強いからで見るのではなく、どんなチームでどんな方法で勝ち上がっていくかを見るのは最高！！！"
Ceb is like Professor from money heist XD
"Ceb is always positive and he always up lift his teammate when they got a bad situation, Ceb got the best attitude for being so patient even so much pressure they felt every game."
Better than avengers movie
"The fact that after the game, the chinese is liek discussing their mistakes.. og is like they just move forward and very positive thinkers"
"n0tail, 'been ready for a long time'. This meant everything to you, you made it, you overcame everything. Relish it for the rest of your life; you're now a god."
But the question is where is the previous coach the over 9000 confidence on TEAM OG winning TI
ti9 de javu

"China Crowd got double the karma now with the disrespect with OG .. ""Go home OG?"" you mean get rekt LGD!  Chinese are the worst CROWD in the entire world !"
"cant wait for True Sight 2019
Never bored watching these thou Nice EDIT valve really2 good work"
"So sorry for LGD, they really deserved to win."
They're just enjoying the game and not giving a fuck about the pressure.
"52:10 ""WIN OR LOSE, WE DON'T CARE, WE PLAY"" 

Motivation lvl 999999999"
*OMFG i got goose Bumps what kind of animation you guys did wooooohaaa*
"Notail, the keyboard Destroyer. 😂

Jk, Love u OG!!!!!!!!! Congratz🎉🎊"
"50:45
n0tail: Oooohh my gooodddd!!! my boyyy!!!
Jerax: oh shitttt! Ana, ur so fuckin good man!!!
Ana: *stare to monitor like nothing happens*"
why notail cant take TI? because Fly..and fly out...notail get 2 TI..:)
"Damn the feelings... No game in the world brings so much emotions. When TI comes, that is when you realise that Dota IS Esport."
"41:00 - 43:18
54:17 - 55:30
58:03

the music is just BREATHTAKING"
"CEEEEEEEB!!!   Sébastien really impresses me. Not just his gameplay. He always stays positiv, steady, conscious, so motivating!  
Johan should not be ashamed of his emotions - its 100% okay, a very natural, good and strong part of him!
Great team! Great Games. Well deserved! Gratz :)"
39:45 Imagine being this much an insecure american that you need to shake your flag in a game that doesn't involve a SINGLE american player.
I wonder when n0tail noticed he forgot his shoes in the booth haha
"38:48
Actual voice over: CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB !
Subtitle: Ceb!
WTF?"
Jerax deserves more appreciation after watching this
Anyone feel so sad for fy?... 😔
"31:00 31:44 
nOtail is the moooooood!!"
so much shit talking from the chinese virgins lmfao
"Now u see how ana and topson evolve !

I bet OG will secure at least top 3 in ti10 

1 year later topson and ana will fucking more badass than they used to be in ti9 ..."
I felt fy
"They became the first team and first 5 players to be 2 time TI winners and first back to back champs while also breaking the West - China curse during TI8, and to think that 2 months before TI8 OG was left broken with 3 players and now they're one of the greatest teams in DOTA"
"The curse says that no team can win TI twice. 


OG: Mate, hold my Lakad Matatag! and my Ceeeeeeeeeeeb"
This docu is too cringey because of LGD 😂😂😂
45:30 GO EMBER I TRUST YOUR FUCKING EMBER   HAHAHA ROFL.. best decision ever made!
I always imagine Fly having a crying jordan's face 🤣
"Im not gonna cry..
.
.
 
.
55:13 - Am i joke to you?"
"Ceb is just too good at motivating, Ana kept being skeptical(which was reasonable) and Ceb just motivates him not to worry."
DJ Kalid: Another One
the BEST TI XD
29:41 that's the team
"Jerax: ana u wanna relo back to the base? 
Jerax: memes?
Ana: fuck off
Jerax: bye bye 😬

🤣🤣🤣"
"I want to play, i want to play,play play play dota  yisssss"
"me: Ana is a very disciplined, high skilled player and worthy of the nickname - A-god... what a talented player. his calm manner allows him to assess the battle very thoroughly and his decision making is absolutely superb 

Ana: idk wtf gOinG oN i cAnT eVeN seE mY owN hErO

an old meme, but still precious. congrats OG for 2 times TI champion"
I'm back here to look at the beautiful crowd this year never had.
"Crap, I just noticed they were holding bananas at 11:37. Bananas are rich in potassium and significantly improves brain activity. Man these guys' preparations were top notch."
Where's axe?
I want true sight ti19.
im crying
It feels good to finally hear ana speak. Gg OG
"""I can't even see my hero"" V.2 - Waiting room"
"Watching notail expression after win TI and still there is a mix of sad in that emotion. someone as kind and loyal as notail he maybe can move on in life but it's hard to forget the memories with the loved one eventhough they are one who betrayed and hurted you.  I know that feel notail. But right now he is back to back TI CHAMP once again KARMA IS A BITCH .
Flower and friendship win in the end"
OGgogo dota2
Watch this after TI9. I feel it will be a different story if LGD has a player like Ceb.
39:05 we've all been there before
you shouldnt make new we just watch this again
This OG team is great. Make teammates confident is the key. They play like they are not in tournament.
"Waiting True Sight TI9
1st Team back to back Champipn in history of dota 2"
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBBB!!!
I just love how they always motivate each other.
"Last Clip of Notail ""I strongly believe that if i woke up in the morning and i had to play the TI final I would play the best Dota of my life and that's all that would matter to me. If I played my Very best nothing else would matter."" from Manila Major then Now your'e Two Times TI Champion."
Ceb is a big help to the team.. Alot of motivation from that guy.. Og will fall with out ceb.. He help in everything
"TI9 PREDICAMENT: 
OGRE = WIN ARCANA 
OG = RE WIN TI
TEA EYE MEANS = THE 👁 IS WATCHING
OG = ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED"
Bacot cina
this is pure feeling..no acting...the greatest movie ever. hahaha
"Looks like OGs are the main characters, and the LGDs are the villains. OG keep motivating each other, LGD trashtalking OG. 😅"
man what an amazing leader ceb is
Slay Slay Slay ... Thats what they do in TI9 :V
Look how they keep up on topson after he made so many mistake 29:40
"""Im ready to lose, Im ready to win, Im ready for everything"""
Cant wait for Truesight: The International 9
Ceb. 👍
"52:56 reaction is because of 
my dumb ass had to watch this like 7 times to understand what happened, so for anyone else in the same boat: ana sells the talisman in his backpack just before dying in order to have enough money for buyback

EDIT he actually sold TWO items and grabbed a bounty rune giving him just enough gold for buyback, AND baited stuns with an illusion. yea that's some TI winner shit for sure"
"""OG Lucky WIN"" LOL Cant stop laughing hearing that."
"OG wins ti again 

Ana: I don't even know what the f**k's going on, I can't even see my hero 🤣"
How short OG in prep in this TI? Their coach don't even have his own OGshirt. And they destroyed each and every team in their path. The pussy in the upper bracket bite dudes.
if you just watch the end only you already watch TI9 True Sight
"TI8 just proves it's not just about mechanical skills, KDA, teamplay, or execution. It's also about trusting each other, believing in each other. It's about genuinely building each other's confidence.

And TI9 is the stage you reach when all that support for each other pays off and you learn to trust and believe in yourself. From the group stages to the grand finals, they ABSOLUTELY STOMPED everybody, and even though they lost a game or two, IN NO SINGLE GAME were they completely dominated. Even the single loss they had to Liquid in the grand finals looked like a playful throw.

Only time will tell for certain, but OG may probably be the greatest dota team ever."
just a bunch of kid millionaires that smoking at street after match.
"Man they are really a living inspirations. Despite being against the odds,they just kept going even if they are gonna to ended up lost. They just want to enjoy and play the game of their life. They had been supporting each other when they need each other the most. Like topson losing faith in himself,ceb and notail kept motivated him. They even picked invoker for topson after he messed up in the previous game because they trusted him. With the faith in their teammates alone,it is enough to conquer everything. Having no doubts in each other. They fight together,they lose together and they win together. They truly deserved the aegis 2x. Team OG,I truly admired your guts of never given up despite the odds. Respect."
can't wait for true sight 2019!
waiting for truesight TI9
"The thing I love about watching OG's documentaries is how much heart they have in them. They are pouring their hearts out, giving it all they've got, with nothing to lose. All the shit N0tail has gone through, all the heartbreaks, hitting rock bottom, picking up the pieces and bouncing back up. Watching him give off this tremendous vibe of not giving up.  Ceb being the ultimate pillar that he is for the team. The feeling of JerAx having your back without fail. Ana's composure and unwavering courage. Topson's mechanical accuracy and sheer talent. It just gives me chills. These five boys were born to play together. Their back to back TI victory is so well damn deserved. Congratulations boys! #DreamOG"
"Lgd: we will get them next year 

Topson: hold my gyro"
The chinese crowd is still crying till this day
"its like i watch watch good movie.. best storyline.. best captain, best team!!"
"LGD is clearly the best methodical Dota team. However, their problem is that they have only one methodical way to play to win.
At 42:11, Ceb clearly highlight LGD's playstyle problem and coming to TI9, LGD still haven't solved this problem. This is the sole reason why LGD lost to the same team three times in a row at TI and ultimately, got knocked out by Liquid at LB TI9."
"I dont really into PSG.LGD member..

but Fy,
 c'mon..
 this guy deserve Aegis, he's really good..
he's one of the best pos 4 in dota2 
i fell really bad for him.."
1:50 that commentator is swallowing his own words. 😂
31:02 wtf ceb is talking? Is dat french?
Whow know music from game 5?
Lgd still dont understand og strategy in ti9😂😂😂
i wanna beat that comentator so annoying
That laugh from notail lmao
Ceeeeeeeeeeb!
"their chemistry is like a real family, maybe that's why they keep winning TI."
"""Do you think ember is still good?"" ""I trust your ember, I trust your fucking ember.""
""Give this boy his Invoker.""

That's how you win games! Complete and utter trust."
"The longer the hair, the stronger he gets. Topson doing some Dragon Ball Super Saiyan shit."
Boring ti9 liquid should give finals to lgd
ANOTHER ONE FOR TI9
waiting for ti9 true sight and re-watching this beautifully made documentary
damn topson nose is bright red
"that's team man 19:38 chen, pl?"
Notail 100% deserved it though i was rooting for LGD
But did he take off the jacket tho
"46:01 

no tail : what u feeling the most 

topson : i mean , idk .. heh heh ..
my god .. hahahahahah"
i need 2019 truesight to be 2 hours pls
5:50 WTF
true sight 2019 will be the best
I'll just keep coming back here until they released true sight of ti9.
You know that gasp of breath by notail on verge of winning is preparation for the surreal feeling.
А TI9 выиграли на изичи!
"This is my game.
-Ceb"
"""Holy crap, Ceb is holding a bunch of papers""


""Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb"""
Who else came to see the “39:06” part after og won the ti9? LUL
Traduzam para PT-BR por favor
"If anyone will tell this story to someone, in the beginnig of 2018, he will laugh at you. And I heard from someones streaming, he said that topson a good player, but he will never be the Tier-1 player, and I want to see his face while topson heading a second aegis. Yeah topson was bad (but not much), giving his tornado or meteor in wrong direction,  but now it's all in past. Now he is just doing a rampages in a monkey king, and ultra on a pugna (I dont' even said about 15 million diffusal blade). He is giving so much space for his core player. Now they are Tier-GOD team now. Congratulations guys. And yes, I WANT TO SEE FLY'S FACE, whike n0tail is got the 2nd aegis!"
"2018 - king of turtling OG
2019 - king of agressive pusher"
A D D E R A L L     B O Y S
Another true sight?
Cant wait for TITS 2019 The International True Sight 2019
"After watching TI9, it's amazing how Topson improved from being an newbie pro to fvcking Godson in just a year"
Fuck LGD
"LGD are strong individually, OG is a great team.
FY is a strong player but Ceb is an amazing leader.
LGD wins the lanes but OG wins the game."
can we have this years true sight focus on the chinese crowds?.. its fun to see thier reactions
"LUL ,, look at all those CHINESE, Probably same faces for the next True Sight"
5:29 cool af
Please have psg lgd vs OG semi in true sight ... i wanna see the stack of paper meme
fy looks like my classmate lol
I like the leadership that Ceb takes into the team. There is nothing but trust for his brothers. I guess that played a very vital role in winning their championships. Congratulations OG!
Really funny 39:13 Hahaha
Ok We need the Truesight of TI9 I wish the LGD shall included at the next trusight XD HAHAHAHA
"from notail sacrificial carry to support
you earn my respect sir
2 time TI Champions"
Ti8 crowd are much better than Ti9
"Plss update ti9 true sight, i waiting it"
58:45 Ooh that didn't age well
"I'm even more impressed than I already was, the trust and teamwork here is incredible. Like when Topson wanted Invoker again they didn't go no you fucked up the first time it was you know what, shit happens and we know you're a good player, you play what you are comfortable with! And they listened to him despite him being fresh from pubs and still green because his opinion mattered. Beautiful. And their attitude was so much better than LGD, they knew they were in this together and no matter what they were proud of each other and I think that's a much better mindset to have than the kind of punishing one LGD had. Like their coach was really intense and that can't foster good decision making under pressure. I have liked OG for a long time now and I'm happy to see them successful!"
"Make a story about OG, the TI champion again"
Topson seems so unsure about his Zeus pick but now he is godson
True Sight is documentary series about good OG fighting bad communists. Gj volvo
came back here after OG won TI9!! 🌻
"Notail Shouting ""Puta""? hahaha"
Looks Like another OG documentary boisss the 2 TIME
Waiting for TI9 True Sight 😅
What a comeback still watch it awesome just shows you never give up anything is possible
"watching this again ... psg ldg says pigs, dumbass, dogs, bitches and all the curse words in China ... damn."

"Ah i can't wait for TI9 true sight, i want it now"
Dear china crowed i think you must see ti 9 true sight hahaha
29:48 eg shirt support og r u serious?
OG 2-х кратные чемпионы. Кто из СНГ -> LIKE
Nice game.
When i watched this you can see that LGD is kind of like the villain and OG is the protagonist of this story. LOVE THIS
Sarap makitang malungkot ang mga inchik hahaha. Tang ina mayabang kasi mga magnanakaw ng lupain na yan eh. Tang ina niyo mga inchik.
Cant wait for truesight 2019!
Wait for true sight TI9 🔥
Fuck man OG so emotional. Im crying right now
I thought this was TI 2019 and half way through i realized it is 2018 xD
Ana with the poker face knows that he shouldnt be happy cause he is going back to school after TI 😂😂
LGD power : BAN
LGD guys are so nice i feel bad for them
"Still a great game from LGD, They just cant Handle OG"
I’m just gonna comeback here next year for TI 10
"Remembering Ana, the man who won TI back to back while he didn't even know where his Hero's are."
Cant wait this true sight
Can't wait for True Sight 2019
58:54 Hahaha Ahhahaha Ahahahahaaaa
"""fluke win ti8 🤣🤣"" pfft"
how to be a 2 time back to back TI champ? have nfi what's going on like Ana.
"""I want to play. Play,play,play. Play Dota"" -Ceb-
This is why they won  TI 2 times"
"24:08. You got this, the next one and then the next one!
Now i'm understand what he meant."
Who's here after OG WINNING BACK TO BACK TI CHAMPION!
"True Sight after TI9 : ohh shiit , here we go again"
LGD doesnt deserve fy tbh
САСАТЬ КИТАЙЦЫ
The ultimate Turtle team OG xD slowly won 2 TIs in a row...well said ! BOi
"present: what is this hero? (talking about ceb's axe)
future: trust me you don't want to know"
OMG OG😱😱😱
"@58:47 ""Take your revenge Next year.""
Meanwhile Ceb taunting chinese crowd in Ti9."
12:42 FY jinxed himself in TI 9.. they lost both UB AND LB Finals after taking game 1 LUL
i like how FY said Kunkka deym thats stylish haha
"""tAkE yOuR rEVenGe NeXT yEaR"""
"This is just like the best TI true sight, I'm not sure TI 9 could be better than this"
Why can't just the crowd be like this?😏
"Ana just ""i cant even see my hero"""
"OG win TI8
Ana: 😐

OG win TI9
Ana: 😐
Also Ana: i think im lil bit tipsy"
Somnus too arrogant. Underestimate opponent too much
"man to notail: which shoulder man? 

it refers to which shoulder cr1t just bumped you with?"
Ti9 no epic moment on final
"4:10 These words carried over so hard to TI9 as well, they even played those characters and man, did Topson smash with monkey."
"@cr1t- I want you to watch this
5:30
That's all I want.
Hahaha"
Watching this almost had me crying. Congrats OG for winning back to back in the TI. Well deserved championship 👏👏👏
Haha No SMOKING..
make another movie on ti9 please :D
cant wait for the true sight from 2019 as 2018 was already amazing!
I'm respect you from my heart OG <3
Some people said that Take your revenge next year? Hahahaha still lose this year didn't even make to the finals. That's what you deserved LGD for being so cocky
The og team true sight
LGD will never be this good without Fy.
From Dogson to Godson really quick
Chinese crowd hahahaha .
"See the different crowd beetwen TI 8 & TI 9
I think more amazing TI 8
Agree?"
I just came here to listen the crowd at the grand final.
"Back to Back
Ti champion
2x times TI champion
OG"
How calm Ceb was wtf??
"Guys I WANT TO REMEMBER THAT SMOKING KILLS, smokers cut off their legs, lung cancer - and IT'S NOT JOKING or fiction - the secrets of manipulation 
400 THOUSANDS A person dies a year in the Russian Federation from SMOKING
WHY do they smoke?"
Ti9 topson is a whole level upgrade from ti8
"In TI8, Topson makes many mistakes, but that's because he's new to the pro scene, in his first professional tournament, he's bound to mess up sometimes.

Now, after 1 year of playing professional games, Topson erased most of his pub gamer habits, the way he dictate the tempo of games in TI9 is just pure ART. The DOTA 2 finally saw what a peak level position 2 player really is, no other pos 2 players can come close to Topson in his ability to create space and control the tempo of the game.


TOPSON = GODSON, TOPFATHER, SON OF GOD, TOP KING OF MIDLANE, MIDLANE TOP NOTCHER."
Who's excited to the upcoming TI9 True Sight?!
who's waiting for the true sight part 2?
"rewatching as well. in game 4, the way Ceb just straight up told them this is his game with Axe like you just know shit is going down.. and that Ceb IS the real deal"
Fy might the best player in Dota2
cant wait for TI9 true sight <3
"They deserve their second win.

It's not the skills that matter, the mentality.

They remained humble and remembered why they played the game in the first place, the love for dota.


I feel those emotions no matter how many times I watch this.


From Frankfurt Major to TI 9, been dreaming green through and through.


GGOG!"
Lol looks like lgd focused more on og than themselves
And now they are back to back champs
"Who's excited for Truesight 2019 OG? !!!!!
CEBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"
that paper can solve all problem ahaha
30:59 LOL Jerax can't take it
"12:25
On est su les nerfs
We are on the edge
-Ceb"
true sight TI9 would be filled with empty seats
"I'm an old-school DoTa Player, and for me I'd like to say I'm a huge fans for All Dota Chinese TEAM bcs they're too strong and you don't wanna wake up them, trust me. But what i am actually want to say is.... this is Wings Gaming CURSE, not TI curse again. They win TI6 and didn't receive money and prize as it should be. Since then China's team never win again. It's a curse since a great player in Wings aren't supported well and neglected. But the things is CONGRATULATIONS OG Team for making a new history in this world. #GGWP #TI9"
Bannn ana at all lol he’s monster so smart
"in a bit we are all gonna see attention seekers coming here saying ""whos here after TI9"""
"Can't wait for another insight! Hope it connects to your ti8 movie.. I will rewatch this again!
Congratulations OG!"
"who else is waiting for TI9 True Sight? 
I think it'll be a shorter one tho."
55:38 Fy reaction so sad :(
Heyy otw again true sight.... 🖤
As retired Dota player i feel happy game i enjoyed is now on Next level ! I might come back but updates  are hard to digest  every year for Noob like me ! Yes i am honest
27:53 the rest is history iykwim
ODPIXEL BEST CASTER
These guys are something else
Here after OG 3-1ed liquid in finals
"It is rare to ever see what really makes champions and what really sets them on another level. It isn't strats, it isn't one hero or one player. Its all of that and none of that. PSG is a great team but OG man...they have a special mindset and confidence that beats their opponents before the game even begins and even if they lose. For this insight into what true artistry looks like and boiling it down to a video format I can understand, this ordinary guy is grateful."
i love how jerax laughing at the moment ceb killing enchantress hahah
OG part 2 coming soon
*Waiting for Part 2*
Who rewatch this just to feel the atmosphere after dead crowd in ti9 final?
"""Holy crap, CEB is holding a bunch of papers!!!"" LOLOL"

"2 год подряд показывают отличную доту, достойны титула"
"man the crowd here really cheered/appreciated the finals, ti9 was literally bias and no cheers for the champs -_-"

Rewatched this after lgd amd liquid. I was hoping lgd would make it to the finals for a rematch but Kuroky and liquid did really well. OG and liquid will be a good match.

Watching this again and again before OG vs Liquid in TI9

"6:33
Holy crap, Ceb is holding a bunch of papers"
this is brilliant . OG is so optimist and Ceb is like a guy you can die side by side.So good so confident.
This fucking made me cry in the end. I hope OG can win again.
Nobody's talking about how good of a venue Vancouver was. The strong Chinese population has the crowd being insanely loud either way whether it's Chinese or Western Dota. Top shelf stuff
Again PSG vs OG in Grand Final
Second ti for OG
49:40 the crowd cheers for LGD so they cheer themselves up with jokes. These guys are the best!
Watching this again hours before the grand finals of TI9
Fcking toxic lgd player
Ive never seen a bigger look of relief on a mans face
Rewatching this before they face off against either Liquid or PSG.LGD again tomorrow ahhhh I can't wait to watch
this year is for you guys too go for it. that aegis is waiting for you
Why am i still crying watching this? I feel like im the one who won 😭
"Don't mind me, just coming back here to rewatch this again before tomorrow's historic grand finals."
I already watch this 8 time cause I like OG
"TI9 ещё не закончился, а уже трусайт финала вышел, ого."
6:34 somnus meme paper
54:31 when you have a noisy friend while watching a movie
"20:12  *This ass is looking at his little notes again* 

Welp 1 year later they did it again."
"Holy crap, Ceb is holding a bunch of papers.

guest what happened today at TI9. lol"
Letsss fucking do this OG for second time straight
2019  2-0  🐖🐖🐖🐖
Ana after open the door : what??? where am I? Why so many people?  What I've done? What the shit is this?
"""Ceb has a bunch of papers""

1 year later..."
Watching this again because of n0tail making paper meme
Better crowd than ti9 bias crowd
Thats why they win Ceb is A positive player
"Im,here waiting for ti9 True sight"
"I think they should pick Timber against Kunnka in mid for Topson, cause obviously LGD again will try to concentrate all the fights in mid, so Timber is really hard to kill and counterpick vs Kunkka. *BUT IT DONT MATTER CAUSE THEY FUCKED THEM YEAR AGO FUCKED TODAY, AND WILL FUCK THEM TOMORROW **_(if LGD will get to the grand finals)_*"
"""Tusk king"" very cocky"
"Hahahaha, speaking french is an amazing talent for looking this video since they don't subtiles Ceb :')"
What lesson do you get it from this ? Dont get over confidence or you will destroy ur own self😂😂😂
Shoulder check 5:30  !!!!
"OG : ah shit, here we go again

all chat : *ceeeb* *ceb* *ceeeeeeeeeeèeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee*"
Im fcking crying !!! Shit i love og verymuch
Dejavu?
jerax is my favorite support here in ti9
"Ceb at 28:55 as Axe: ""This is my game boys""!

ODPixel at 38:47: ""Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb, gets the call of his lifetime""

Indeed was Ceb's game :)"
Dejavu TI9
"Hi, 2019,24 august.Today OG again in Grand Final.You came here to see this after OG win 2nd TI in a row?)Or after True Sight TI9?)"
LGD being the Chinese being and the Asian they where was talking about technicalities of the game on break while OG decided to enjoy their final match and what happened? They won. Moral of the story? Just play the game and enjoy it because in the end its just a game.
AND ITS HAPPENING AGAIN
whos here after the rematch ? LOL
"Here, after *OG* vs *LGD* final upper bracket."
"And now, second finals are coming..."
"Already watched this before, but shit this still excites me"
"topson: what the fuck, we won TI!!!
ana: it's real dude, it's real XD"
LETS GO BOOOOOYS
This stupid cinematic scene.. ffs show us the real one ...
Makes me cry every time.
"This OG team really enjoy the game specially this ti9. I don’t see any pressure. They just enjoy the game win or lose and you can see that they are not aiming to be the champion this year. I mean LGD is deserving to win but, i will not be surprise if OG are the first team who wins the back to back championship."
Комната ожидания второй победы ОуДжи ♥
Had to re-watch to get hyped for tomorrow's UB final. Cmon bois!
"24/08/2019 Grand Final Upper Bracket Ti8 OG vs PSG.LGD 
O      G       
LIKE : OG WIN
Coment : LGD win"
Still topson is the lucky bastard
what a truly inspiring player. Topson the best! And i tried to play pubgame to practice invoker quas wex but sadly one of my team said mid or tiny airlines
"n0tail might have lost fly, a 10 years old best friend but he found a new one in ceb. Ceb is very much a true friend for n0tail than fly would ever be."
a legendary ti finals
ceeb <3
"""GIVE THE BOY INVOKER""
even he is shit last game
that how you make your teammate feel confident, that how you win a game
Ceb is a genius"
Ceb is best! This was the most exciting final ever.
"Get ready for OG vs LGD rematch, battling the slot for the Finals. Same scenario last year bois"
"Watching TI 9 , and then watching this LGD go ""lets mute them"" LMFAO. They trolled EG so hard"
watching this again before OG vs LGD match tomorrow. uwu
please la subtittle to indonesia😢
"Fuck this somnus, so arrogant face"
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb!
It’s so good to watch these Chinese losing the final !!!! So much for talking cock
"""never forgive, never forget""


that makes no sense, dude."
Ceb keeps the team together
Not much left untill they are the first 2 time champs!
"Ceb... it's real! CEB!! God, my tears..."
"I FUCKING LOVE THESE BOYS MAN~, i hope they repeat"
"Rewatching it after they beat EG again. Let's go, boiz"
OG OG OG OG
who rewatch this after watching Red Bull documentary?
I really love how n0tail didn't blame Topson for the invoker. Like it was the team fault instead. It's so good
Watching this again before OG vs LGD
Who is here after og once again winner bracket finals? Hoping og will breaks one more ti curse and become the only team to win two ti and back to back champions.
39:43 crowd looks like they're watching football.
for something deemed so nerdy this is SO BAD ASS TO WATCH!!!!
"well they won ti9 again, and psg lgd and og on the finals again. First team to 2-peat."
Both teams deserves the Aegis.
how nice to look at these sad Chinese faces!
That topson rage face in the end haha
"I strongly believe that if I woke up in the morning, and I had to play the TI final, I would play the best DotA of my life. That's all that would matter to me. If I played my very best, nothing else would matter.   ----N0tail"
let the players do their thing..thats the problem of PSG LGD...
"Я выиграю Ti,я сделаю это."
Love the scene...go OG back to back champion ti9
"Try to think of it.

Liquid is blue, ti7 is blue
OG is Green, ti8 is Green.

Who wins in ti9?"
The moral support from Ceb legit won them the tournament.
14:40 konkkaaa
watching before TI9 main event start
I LIKE OG THE GOD
"ez
 EMBER"
"55:17 watching the whole true sight for 10th time, still got those goosebumps"
I was there in Vancouver when these 5 beautiful games took place. Made some friends from USA and cheered for OG all the way. Such an incredible experience. We used to analyze the drafting. Best day of my life the atmosphere was really electric man I don’t have words. Coming here again to see this beautiful documentary and new one from Red bull. Let’s go OG!
"Zeus with SS they have the map vision advantage,
NP with unli TP advantage and can push very well and pressure his opponents,
Rubick can steal any of important skills from the opponent, including the silence, fissure etc.
Ana's Ember spirit build is very hard to kill, 
His skill and item build with euls  and linken, 
And ceb their incredible leader has a very tanky magnus, has a crowd control..
Their last lineup was perfect."
Lakad matatag
If OG win TI9 i will be fucking crying from all the inspiration
Самая достойная команда!!!!надеюсь и на TI9 победят
LAKAD MATATANGGG!!!!
"tnc will be the next champion 
go tnc ❤️"
Holy shit I just noticed the two subtle gachi AAAH screams at 0:53 xD gachiBASS
"(28:08)Ceb: your gonna see some shit man 
(a few minutes later) Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeebbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I just started vlogging a few months ago and I want say that they used the best bgm for this documentary. It really fits it, like I'm watching a movie."
Bruh the chinese talk alot of shit
So good but the CG-cinematics ruins all the highlights =(
KungKaaaaah 14:41
"OG seems very promising in Ti9 they dominated groups and lgd seems at their best aswell.
Its too early, but could  ti9 have a rematch final?"
what name of the guy sit next to ana when ceb was coaching?
"And now og carrying with IO
LOL"
why are asians so salty lol
30 Million PRIZE POOL LETSS GOOOOOOOOO
"This story really seems like fairytale where LGD is such a final boss who revived after upper bracket final, and OG is the super underdogs. I rewatched this after redbull documentary, damn this story is really really epic. They play without fear of losing nor getting subtituted. There are so much to talk about.


""If you're LGD and you watch that, you must be thinking that God's not on your side or something"" - N0tail"
OG dominating TI9 groups. It's INSANE!
"This closeup on Ana's PL when Jerax says ""They have a really big problem""  at 35:56 <3"
Ana straight up looks likr those handsome anime guys
"You can see the difference on how they handled pressure. Lgd was by the book, strained, doubtful while OG let it all go in their final draft, play as if your last, fun and unconventional and optimistic. Aside from being a great player I think mentality is also important"
"God they ruined the  ""Ceeeeeb"" moment with that boring and loud animation. Why not just show the ingame part?"
No smoking area but he fvcking dont care
"Maybe fly has the TI curse on his shoulders... any team he joins, loses... XD"
Zub
There will never be another TI with a better underdog story and a more deserving winner than this one!
"FIX FUCKIGN MMR SYSTEM RETARDS, WE WAIT IN SEARCH EVERY GAME ARAUND 80 MIN, HELOOOOOOOOO"
"I really hope fy win TI this time, its so hard to watch him being so sad and disappointed after losing to OG. That was so heartbreaking moment. Even notail see it. Great player, just not so lucky, hmmm. Good luck fy, i hope u have a good moment in TI 9. Sincerely from ur fan."
"ana: hmmm. do u think ember still good?
knowing too well he'll rekt LGD with ember."
"""Ceb we won!!"" 😭"
OG giving us that YOLO feels while LGD is giving us that pressured feeling. Best Series ever tho
THIS FUCKING ANIMATION REMOVING THE THRILL OF THE CEB CALL FCK OFF VALVE
"TI9 is Come.

I Just hope next true sight is more like this."
"TI9 is Come.

I Just hope next true sight is more like this."
"That's not the attitude of a true gamer psg lgd..
They had no versatility..
Don't even know axe? Like wtf..
Man they're good but their attitude while in game turned me off..
That's why og beat their asses out.."
"Ohuennye subtitry, sooqa"
Today it 9 start
"TI group stage to begin later. Rooting for VP and OG. Still, this video gives me goosebumps everytime I watch it. #VPwin"
All six of them ...
forever immortal
omg my eyes hurt when they zoom at Topson. Definitely the ugliest dota2 player (except some of the chinese players obviously)
who's here before TI 2019?
ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeebbbbbbb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Do you like invoker?
Yeah.
Give the boy invoker
Mid or feed ahahhahah"
music please
from open qualifiers to BO1
38:49 can you tell how proud his parents were?
"How to win TI
Drop all protocol n strategy n pick ur fav. heroes , dont care whether u win or lose n man up 👍😊😊!!!"
It’s new year’s eve and your waiting for that spaghetti sauce 55:43
Against the Odds.. had to rewarched this
That ceeeeeeeeeeeb call still give me goosebumps
35:56 so cool moment
wtf zeus topson ahahahaha
Cant wait for TI9
"you have to give credit for the folks who compose the music, damn beautiful work, 54:19"
Og deserved it
No chinese teams are hitting semi finals in ti9 and all of us will see those crying face of chinese crowd
OG NEVER LOSE GAME 5!
"i dont understand why lgd very scared with ceb looking at his note hahahaha
it just a hero picture so he can see clearly instead of staring at the monitor"
I’m here to play video games - JerAx
"These Chinese players calling each other cute names. Baldy, Sea Cotton, Big Brother and Baby."
Going to the no smoking sign right next to a little kid and lit a cigarette like a boss
I could be half way through falling down a cliff and Ceb could convince me I was okay.
"""all six of them."""
watching this again before TI9
Thx Notail
"When i get old:

Grandson: can you tell me a great story      
in your time?




Me: okay, sit down and listen (story about ti8)"
"28:13 ""They dare to pick axe in front of the tusk king? ""

In game: CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB!"
"the way somnus saying ""Kunkka"""
"LoL player here, I watch most  the pro games and the tournaments in LoL but I feel like dota pros are so much more toxic than lol players. like in lol the players from diff regions are still pretty friendly but here they look so distant. is it just me or is this how it usually is?"
"i dont even play dota, then why i cant stop watching it ?"
Fucking fucking fucking goood..pinaka maganda laro sa kasaysayan ng Dota..
shoutout ABC Kids shows
the most emotional TI ever..
"I'll go against Spectre..
after the game:
Fuck Spectre is so badass"
"48:28 the reason Ana so calm and confidence because the nonstop verbal moral support from his teammate,  Dota2 it's win by teamplay, no team on earth can win the TI by 1 vs 5 if anyone say otherwise he/she don't know anything about Dota2"
Why do i always come back here :(
cant wait for ti9! lgd so good but not their time yet. soon tho :D
"Please make it 2 hours of TI9 true sight this time, we really enjoyed watching this. Feels goosebumps from watching this!"
"Chinese crowd is really annoying really,"
watch this documentary before TI9 begin :D
"that hardwork that they have put into.. I am spending my holiday and weekends practicing data structure and algorithm, I hope I can hold the offer letter from Google high up in the air soon like how NoTail held the aegis."
"100 HOURS FOR THE TI 9
GIVE ME THE HYPE BOYSSSSSS !!!!!!!"
"OG loses a teamfight : It's ok guys you're doing great, we'll fucking them up
LGD loses a Teamfight : u didn't have tp, that tf was on you"
I cry tears of joy everyone I see the ceb axe play
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb!!!
"This is So Heroic. I like how Ceb and Notail stayed Possitive. That mentality of comfroting his teamates telling them its okay on their mistakes and think they will crush them..

Good Job so Heroic."
who rewatch this after watching Red Bull documentary?
"It's nearly ti9, and I'm still watching this hotness"
Up next: OG watching true sight ti8
my boi n0tail deserved. Huge inspiration for me.
"What is the Ana's keyboard? 2:47, please, help. I want it."
"Why every Chinese team always ""LOOK"" so anger in pursuit of winning? Since TI 3 or in The Major. They don't take chill in every single game. Why?? They'd no fun at all."
"After rewatching this, i felt the sadness of this girl in 54:45"
I want Ceb to be my inside voice to motivate me thru life ;D
Ceb is just... so freaking good at coaching and motivating. considering he played himself and won the hole tournament this is probadly the best story of esports history.
6 days before TI. Lets watch it again! 💕
top 10 anime combacks
"Как же я не люблю такое освещение. В этом видео специально освещают китайцев как плохих парней показывая моменты где они ругаются ,а ОГ максимально выбеляют  ,прям видео для светлых любителей демократии ,любящих как дети все делить на черное и белое ."
55:34 i really felt the pain.
"I really like this documentary, because it shows sometimes how good second place already is, yet its never remembered or celebrated. A lot of respect for both teams."
What did notail yells at 31:00 ??
You can just tell after game 4 that OG had won the mental game hard.
"dota nace, i love so much dota"
Dota 2 is the best e sport!!!!
Was noTail smoking a joint before the game??
I wait for TI9 final when chaos vs liquid and at game 5 matumbaman get Rampage and the last guys he kill is w33 for winning a TI yeah what i hope is ridicolous but fuck off liquidfangay
"25:38 she could just say ""please wait"". how rude."
"Watched this again after watching Red Bull's Against the Odds.
Still gives me the chills!"
"Team :"" Okay so what is our strats? ""
n0tail :"" SWEATPANTS! """
GOODBYE CHINA!! GO HOME!!! THAT IS OG!!!!!

"Topson : ""we won TI, what the fuck"""
45:29 ana knows he'll destroy LGD with his ember ;)
Where is ame?

Don't be so rude SOMNUB
"Hey SOMNUS REMEMBER WHAT DID YO SAY? ""WHO WIN 1ST GAME ALWAYS FINALLY LOSE"" HOW NOW? CAN I PUNCH YOUR MOUTH? HAA? COME SAY IT AGAIN, YOU'RE FUCKING NOOB FOOL HAHAHAHHHAAHHHAA"
Asa like as his face
"Fucking idiot SOMNUS , FOOL HAHAHAHAAHAHA"
Remember this days guys
56:00 Ana came out of the cave and he didnt know WTF is going on. Luckily he had Topson's guidance 😂
I got emotionally invested in OG and N0tail
55:13 that reaction from bigdaddy is priceless
This give a fucking life advice
2053 anyone?
Like a cinderella story
Kesini cuma liat cingcong pada sedih.
38:49 just in case u wanna hear ceb
Still watching? HAHA move on it's already Ti9 😄
"39:16
i don't even know what the fucks going on, i can't even see my hero - PL by ana
yet still champion, wtf..."
"I really like how somnus said ""Kunkka"" in game 2, it sounds villain."
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb! that was a game changer play. that led into winning TI
20:39 singsing live cam stream
"41:49 ""I want to play, play play. play dota!"" We need this voice in game"
"Team og: WOAHHH
Ana: woa"
Ana youre so fuckin good man 😂👌
"Watching this Before TI9

( I predict VP )"
This video makes me smile for the rest of the day. So Great
WHOS HERE BEFORE WATCHING TI9?
Smoking is bad for you!
37:31 i love ana's response it's fucking funny
smokes right next to the big fuckoff NO SMOKING sign 😂😂😂 17:38
i cried
For those  news reporter and news channel who thinks it's just a game then they need to watch this.
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB
I can't stop watching this
"This movie is just a Masterpiece of art! .. WHO THE FUCK DIRECTED THIS >> ""JAMES CAMERON"" ?!"
"after watching this over and over again, I conclude that global silence has more effect on teammates and supporters than their enemies."
Great documentary
"China fans: LGD will win!




55:36
staff: Ah shitt! here we go again."
I wanna see this at ti9 how a team crushes chinese teams to defeat
TI9 in two weeks
"Topson invoker..




Its special.."
"Im LOL player and they seem to similar what G2 doing. They're enjoying and killing it. I really enjoy watching it. I'm not in to DOTA2 cuz too many things new to learn, big champion pool and that stuff. Still watching this OG documentary is interesting and entertaining. 
Is OG in 2019 that strong still?"
no matter what. FY will always be F GOD.
"55:13 that feel. Amazing documentary, felt like I was next to them as they felt the surge of those emotions."
"Anyone in 2019 , Waiting for TI9?"
"""if I played my very best, nothing else would matter""

- N0tail"
This game proves that startegy does not work all the time. You need to play with the hero where your confidence is at 100%.
After watching this i can't wait for the next TI.
Ceb it's real ceb.It's real.C'on ceb it's real.💘
EG got cucked. Which is the best part
"I wanna get back to dota when I watch this,"
31:04 jerax was laughing because notail shouted and the way ceb talk randomly 😂
I've watched 55:00-55:35 about 15 times now
I still get goosebumps! ♥️ OG!
Arrogant stupid ass LGD calling them dumbasses once LGDs confidence break they have nothing to stand up.again
Через месяц новый финал а я смотрю старый как же ахуенО!)))
"42:50 ''i hit 15,000 hours of dota'' lol"
"If I played my best, nothing else would matter. Dang, motivating speech"
"38:38
""Where's Axe?""
38:48
Axe: DING DING DING MOTHERFUCKER!!!"
"Hahaha 
https://youtu.be/v7cEgnr-_5A"
this what u get when look down on other people
I don't even play Dota but this was beautiful
"""it comes down to half a sec"".....? the fgc scoffs at your struggles."
I love OG!
I am so happy that OG is the same team this year!
SUCK IT LGD !!!!!!
Who else is watching this before ti9 starts?
"Ceb - The guy you want on your team. ""STAY STRONG TOPIAS - ILL FUCKING KILL HIM'"
HA! SIKE!
who has watched it again and again for motivation ?
gaaaaaaaaaaaa
"The way notail just hugs the trophy is so heartwrenching! 59:20
You're seeing years and years of chasing a dream manifest itself in his subconcious body language. The way he just holds on to it, and keeps it near his body. There's something so fucking beautiful about it. You can see him blinking as if waking from a long slumber. His dream finally made reality."
Where is miracle
wtf there's more?? after the Freetoplay?
"Man, this video still gives me chills. Especially the epic music starting at 41:48"
Still love to watch💖
Ceb's motivational speeches probably won them the game here ... too good!
Somnus look very cocky. Glad they lose
"Ceb: We already won everything we had to win here
OMG that might really hurt fly"
"Even won
ANA : 😐"
Woww
25:24 that jinx
"How sad are you? 
Me: 54:45"
Get rid of the animated fight scenes for next one pls. Really ruined the moments
They have to do one of these for CS:GO !
The way he said kunkka at 14:45 for some reason gave me chills idk y thou
Go Home LGD
Go home LGD .HAHAHA
"""Ceb, it's real"""
"this autoplayed and i said ""well i guess I have to watch this for the third time"" and here I am an hour later"
Watched it again and still epic af. Music is making this so intence gj with the pickings.
"looking for echo slamma jama,... and there isnt"
Ah.. My monthly dose of Ti8 true sight to motivate me .
Anyone knows the music on 7:30?
One should see what notail does to Kunkka on the game 5 at the Roshan fight. His micro skills completely disables Kunkka from the fight. It looks hilarious. He wants to get to the fight but trees just keep popping in front of him and blocking him out.
GO FUCKING EMBER
The shot with PL lvl. 25 was so funny.
Says the other team's messy and that they're all dumbasses. Lose that very game. WP morons.
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb!
Newbee's player have more good attitude than PSG LGD
"LGD went cocky enough to get ""fking fked"" by OG :)))"
"Holy shit Ceeb is holding a bunch of paper is that legal? I'm pro OG and asian, but they really made this a bit Chinese biased, lol. Wonder if it be cut differently if  LGD won? Picking NP a nod to their old rival Alliance (Admiral Bulldog) during TI3, and also during the Dreamhack/HON/Dota 1 rivalry days."
does ame ever talk
666k sub pogchamp
im still watching it for 49 times i reallly love this true sight edition
"Ana: I don't know what the fuck was going on, I can't even see my hero.
XDDDDDDDDDDDDD"
55:15 moments like this are why dota is the best game in the world.
This video was so amazing..once again congrats for OG..nice one team
"I don't play DOTA, but I feel their triumph as they lifted up that trophy"
1 month till ti9 the feels here we go again.
This was one of the best Event I've ever attended. It was literally China v.s The World in the arena. I'm excited for TI9! It will be a Bloodbath!
"39:11 - Ana, say if u get Ruptured  because ARIARIARARI out
Wha..aaa..oooookay,ssssuuure.."
"og are just fake champions who bought this aegis, LGD are real winners :)"
Notail always lighting up cigarette every end of the game.
Kunkaaa
Kunka
only 15k omegalul
"Thanks OG. You taught me nothing to lose. Stay focus and work hard. EPIC COMEBACK IS REAL. GGWP

Love OG from indonesia"
fy PMA
"""Team that wins game 1 always lose finals."" 
Not OG bruh"
BidDaddy brooooo! Esketit
LGD still got like 4 million dollars. Ok be sad but CHILLAX.

"Watched this again for the umpteenth time. Not for the amazing plays. Not the CEB speeches. Not for the CEB call. Not for the incredible comebacks. But for the last 30 seconds. I could have just started the video from there. But its not the same as reliving possibly the greatest e-sports grand final series ever and then listening to those immortal words;

That last qoute by n0tail during the manila major 😭😭
fy is god
"It mustve hurt, that the only lose LGD suffered using Earthshaker, is their lastgame to win the aegis"
Fy played out of his mind that entire series
DEAD GAME !
I put this in the background... as I am doing work...pure motivation
"LOOK THOSE CHINESE ALL FACE :V lol...

Anyone has any link to the soundtracks in this True Sight?
LGD's coach can't catch a break bro lmao. I remember when he was in EHOME and they lost against Na'Vi in TI 1 lmao
"How to intimidate your opponent.


Step 1: Hold a lot of paper. 


LMAO"
imagine winning something without your best friend. its how n0tail feels that time.
"fy feelsbadman
his Tusk, his Earthshaker, his Phoenix, he played so well in that whole series"
indeed the best TI so far. I hope TI9 would beat this.
"7:38 I know, I so fucking know...




Open AI for bots plays."
"TLDR
LGD = doubts here and there
OG = YOLO lolololol"
Ana is like the Kawhi of Dota
"I love hove Ceb just calls: ""This is my game boys"" lifting the team up when you face elimination. And following up, some great leadership right there."
39:05 the pain when u play as PL
"Сильные эмоции, супер игра от команд!"
"When the Chinese team wins the TI, there are no videos about their championship process."
still watching and enjoying how the china crying like a bitch =D
"FUVK, I LUV ANA!!!!"

ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
It took me 4 months to realize AME was in this
The drafting part gives me chills
55:14 that ‘this is happening for real’ n0tail’s expression
"This is so Wow! seriously intense video, try also this link for more cool and awesome videos https://ckk.ai/GLDWE Well played guys. ciaaoo!"
This translator...... most of what Lgd says are a bunch of swear words lol
"People be saying that the Fly-Notail drama was harsh, but lets be honest, Notail going from 1 pos to support and together with ceb using their knowledge to help the young stars shine it's what really made this team work.
When someone pulls you back you have to use the space to jump fuckin foward."
I see China lose I click
"Whenever I lose many ranked games, lose my motivation to play and so done with dealing toxicity in-game becoming toxic myself. I take a break, grab food and some beer and watch this ti8 finals. So damn inspiring. It's not just about the game itself but the whole team of OG amazes me. TY OG."
Hahahah fuck china poor china
The arrogance of LGD is the reason why they lost..
As a dota player if this doesnt bring you to tears then you should prolly quit playing dota.
just like what happen in kiev major fighting againts VP...
GREAT!
59:11 look like anna and notail is having a baby or something
ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
Can’t wait for true sight 2019
Ana will always be my favourite.
"I've played very minimal Dota, but honestly props to the editing team of this video. The little animations they have at crucial moments really make it easier to understand what's going on."
30:50 It was at this moment that LGD realized.... They f&$@& up...

I hope someday i can play in a tournament like this

"They dare to pick axe in front of tusk king?

somnus deserve this TI actually.
Ceb’s positive mental attitude was commendable.
59:02 Ceb is so pure we must protect him at all cost 😭❤
"OG ups and downs

UP: OG on the top of the game, 
DOWN: Gets un UPSET and lost its best player.

UP: Regrouped and had the best runs on TI group stage, 
DOWN 1-2  in the final.

Best Part: Played the last 2 games the way we should play DOTA (enjoy and believe on team mates and yourself).   

 *WON TI👏👏👏"
"i love how Ceb manages the team, like he's letting every member pick on their own, in heroes where they're more comfortable to use. I love it, he encourages them that whatever heroes they're handling, they're still going to crash the enemy. he's really positive ❤ respect"
38:48 the iconic *CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB!*

Notail dont smoke too much pls

"40:20 JerAx's smile says something like ""finally played the best game of my life"""
"You know what I see...

People opening their mouth. 😂"
"Still i got goosebumps , even though i watched this , the greatest comeback TI"
if they just swap moggy with him they will surely have a chance at ti9
They lose  because of ame he is not a good carry
Какие радостные og  и какие грустные lgd

"Ds is just like USA VS CHINA...hahaha
They tot d can win..lol
They tot d are better..lol
But its only tot..lol"
"TI8 is when I returned to following the DOTA scene again...

...just in time to see a great underdog run. It's like in Tekken, where this Korean kid uses a low tier character and the proceeds to slaughter the Korean gods of Tekken. Damn."
"25:15 ""If we win the next game, remember to take off your jacket."" Welp, too bad he will be wearing that jacket forever."
TUSK KING?!!!!
Still watching..?????  Kudos for both team.  those supports are really amazing !
"Holy shit...The ember pick was actually epic
""Guardian of the flame!"""
the optimism of OG
So many of the Asian teams are too cocky and when things dont go exactly as they want they crumble. They never know how to deal with teams doing audacious and different things during a match either.
PSG got cocky and got fucked for it lol
WHAT A TRUE SIGHT. I KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS TRUE SIGHT . GOD I LOVE THIS SHIT
Rly love notail
anyone still watch this movie in june?
The best fking ti8 and I've been watching since ti :D
Как же обидно за fy

"No one:


Battle pass users: Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb!!!"
Damn these chinese cuss a lot

Chinese PSG.LGD doesn't deserve the crown.
Even though I don't like current OG.... this is very emotional...
"""Ana, you wanna reloc into the base? Memes?"" Hahahahahaha!"
Notail just smokes right in front of the no smoking sign at 17:44 hahaha badass
i see a lot of openings like *Mouth of those people* ... space created haha ...

"If you do not do this again for TI9, you are robbing the DOTA community. This is epic shit!!!!"
Gotta say the animations were pretty cool
psg too cocky
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb!
"Newbee attitude more better than psg lgd, lol"
I like how OG let in everything in the end. They don't even care the draft anymore. They just let everyone pick what they want and confident is all they have against all odd. What a breath taking moment.
Fire bird vs ice bird .phoenix vs winter w.

Who the fuck smokes in 2019? — I guess Dota millionaires.
57:03 Wtf? Where at the hell is Ana?
"56:36 When ana shakes their Hands..""Did i kill your souls?"
"51:10 if they listen to this guy.
They made a Huge mistake"

PL lvl 25 sound effect sends shivers down my spine 💯💯💯👌👌
"if you want to know what ceb said at 30-33 approx mins, it was ""fuck their moms"". ""their moms are whores"" and ""their moms are prostitutes"" lol, i don't know why valve and dota 2 would put that in this documentary. I guess they don't know what it means."
NO CAM and MIC for AME? Really good carry btw.

"China learns, it's not No.1............."

9:44 BRING BACK AI
"These chinese player are so arrogant,feel like they are going to win the game but in fact they get smashed 3-2,and how embarrassed it is hahaha"
So satisfying to see those overly-confident and arrogant chinese (players and crowd) lose. Karma’s a bitch bruh.
"55:40 the guy at the back is like, get me out of here lmaooo"

And still valve want to have TI9 in china??? Whenever a chinese team loses... The biased crowd will just be quiet and that pretty sucks 😒 no hype for stream no hype at all! Winners from other places will either get complete silence or boos from the crowd. I know im not the only one who thinks like this

Amazing video. Thank you.

"Late game.. 48:35.. OG was whole TI like that.. big comebacks, superb mid and late game.. just incredible dota"
"OG really deserve this winning. Initially LGD crowd was damn rude shouted ""OG Go Home!"" Now is ""LGD Go Home"""
One of the greatest stories in Dota 2 and all of e-sports. ggwp
111
I thought it might be fun to go to TI until I saw the crowd in this video and they are all staring straight up at the monitor. Looks like literal pain in the neck to do that for hours and hours. Maybe I'm just officially an old man now....
chills
The Chinese players got executed by the government when they got home ?
Open steam pick axe and feed
9:44 so that's how you can make a good shout cast.. does tobiwan also do that?
Did you guys spot zai aswell on around 11:33 ?
Its reall...... They said its reall... I'm cryingggg
"holyshit, its amazing and also painful to watch, i can really feel what lgd feels, losing is sucks"
Go home lgd fans idiots. Have tears of losers.
39:05 LMAO
"54:05
How LGD knows they are losing, but they know they have to fight, even though they doubt they'll win hits me harder then it should, especially when the music plays from 54:20. From the sight of the LGD fans knowing that they won't win TI this year, then showing fy, their captain, not knowing what to do or say to save his team.

54:46 and onward is especially really dramatic. When Chalice dies, it cuts to him. When Somnus dies, it cuts to him. When xNova dies, it cuts to him. The players at that time realizes that they come all this way, only to lose at the final game of the tournament. Knowing how Chinese people's mentality works, that's still devastating.

I rooted for OG, but if you don't feel what LGD felt at all, you're probably not a human. Valve really made one hell of a movie, props to everyone for their efforts."
I just watch a very amazing movie better than avengers endgame sorry if got offended but thats the fact
whenever LGD loses a full team clash they are all quiet.. while OG ceb and bigdaddy immediately motivates everyone and throws some funny lines. that is something youll need with that kindnof pressure!!
"Still Watching MAY 2019! <3

TUSK KING MY ASS! HAHAHA"
KUNKAAAAAAA
"Whenever the Chinese team loses, their coach talks down to his team... and when they win they trash talk.
When OG loses, their coach motivates them, this leadership difference may have been the deciding factor"
go home china hahahaha
"I like how they've also put in all the cursing of the players, just shows how real it is"
"Ceb such a strong and dependable morale support for the team, he's the kind of guy we desire on whatever kind of work/job anywhere."
"What is the language ceb uses for ""We are on edge"""
"As a LoL player, dota tournament looks so much serious and stressful. These players are playing like their lives depend on it, so much respect for them. I can't imagine all the struggles physically and emotionally they have to went through to lead up to this point. This is what i call a real E-Sport, it is no longer a game it's your life"
"its just me crying on this video.?
OG deserved this."
Wise people once said: Go Home OG!
ana is the real deal man.
"45:30 Look, Ana's confidence is scary."
The axe cutscene buyback is top notch!
"The only curses remaining are: The Champion's Curse, and The Reigning Champion's Curse."
why am I crying? Im watching this like for the 3rd time now!
"""Go home OG""? Hahahahah,,  the other team and their fans was about to cry as a matter of fact :)"
indopride
and here i am still watching this video. It is hands down the greatest moment in Esports. Call it the underdog story if you want. OG was more then prepared for this moment and they conquered. Ceb deserves coach of the year with his outstanding motivation. He was like a father to these guys making sure they cherish the moment win or lose. Gotta love it
"n0tail said it first, win the mental game and you win the series. OG won the mental game completely. LGD blamed each other, talked down to their opponents and didn't support each other, so they lost."
buff slark
"What a positivity. One more game to lose and ""it doesn't matter""."
I came to watch this every month to feel motivated to play dota
i had goosebumps the whole video
I Strongly believe that if i woke up in the morning and had to play the TI final i would play the best Dota of my life and that's all that would matter to me if i played my best. Nothing else would matter. -N0tail.
Fcking love it
Damn! Felt like I watched a movie. So intense!
"I want to see og vs liquid, 2 good in making comebacks. Hope they'll fight in the finals in ti9"
"In my opinion, whatever sport you play, if you have enough skill and motivation, the mentality that OG showed here is the only thing that will make the difference :

1 - They play for the pleasure
2 - They have full and sincere respect and trust towards each others

It's so rare and so complicated to manage to release the pressure and yet keeping somewhere in mind that you have to give your best.

To me the best moments of this video are a lot around Ceb, but if the rest of the team wasn't embrassing his attitude, it wouldn't be the same :

1 - Ceb positive and yet very aggressive attitude.
2 - Their fake ( ofc they prepared to get in troubles but it's never simple to manage once you're in it ) coolness when they're in a bad situation
The perfect example of the Ceb attitude effect is when Topson is getting harassed, he's like "" fuck I'm losing it "" but his brain is never telling him "" your team hates you "", nope, his brain is telling him "" don't worry, your team is behind you "".
3 - When they take decisions about the picks and they take it very lightly on the last game, it is always better to reinforce your moral with a comfort pick than making the perfect plan which involve you're gonna play a game with a non stop thaught coming to your mind every second of it ( "" I don't like this, I don't like this, I'm too bad with this pick "" ).

I don't know if they are totally aware of what they did or if it was just a "" don't give a fuck "" induced behavior, but they fucking nailed it and what they did is pbbly the most beautiful human thing I saw for a long time !"
"Best video about esport ever done, first time I cry about a competition, masterpiece job True Sight !"
"I just started to watch Dota 2 competition today, the positive attitude of Ceb is just fucking incredible, he can make Death itself look like a kawaii rabbit...

Congrats to them !"

@11:33 is it Zai on the top left
OG: showed that you don't need the best players to win TI but the players working as the best team. DOTA2 truly a team game.

"3:43 Is the best scene for me. Look how NoTail looks so humble and tries to communicate with PSG.LGD  by looking at them and possibly give them a nod as a sign of greeting if they meet his eye. Sadly enough, none of them looked back at him."
why PSG.LGD jacket looks like prison uniforms
Waiting to TI9 !!!!

i rly love this True Sight's  they are just amazing GJ !

"After Game 4 you can start to see n0tail feeling nervous and emotional already.

"Did anyone noticed that LGD wants to take off their jacket if they win TI8 because they want to represent China, not PARIS, which is written at the back of their jacket. But damn they never did take off their jacket at the last moment, maybe because they want to represent PARIS because they lose. 🙂"
damn the chinese players really did predict what theyll pick or ban fckkk mannn.. thats just being pro af.

LGD players are arrogant that's why they lost the championship
"The direction in this documentary is so freaking great. I don't even play dota, yet i've already comeback here for I think 5th times. The emotion really flow through the players and this documentary portrayed it all beautifully. Will definitely comeback for more TI."

I'm gonna cry..."
"I support the OG to win this TI but when i rewatch it i feel so sad about the chinese team, we dont know how discrimination works on their country as a player who doesn't get the glory for their country."
"LGD GO HOME,  ROFL"
Ceb is the MVP for OG without a doubt. His plays though incredible were also done when needed by others. But his role in motivating the team and reassuring the team when they were heavily down was awesome. Coaching while playing. No wonder OG are able to do so many comebacks that was usually deemed a lost cause. This guy has nerves of steel
“Holy shit ceb is holding a lot of paper” 😂😂😂
"When LGD lost game 5 from OG, LGD fans literally were global silenced. Lmao."
lol. i love the little shit talk. it ain't dota without that

Respect fy
Truesight is truly the epicness materialized.
Is Og coach tony stark? Jk
Wow really good game op axe ceb😮😮
this makes me cry every time i watch it. better then most movies now days. dota will always be the best game ever made
"Hopefully fy will win next ti, this man really deserve aegis imo."
The LGD players.... are you actually taking pills or drugs just to play games?
"we die together
we stay together 
we slay together
we slay together

who the fuck that 1k guy dislike this video???
"Imagine in game 4 if they didn't ban Centaur. Then Ceb would've picked Centaur and who knows, we might not have the winning call of axe from Ceb."

Anyone know what's ceb says in 12:30 ?
JOE JONAS is TI CHAMP!!! wth!
Kongkaaa - somnus 2018
Uhhh!° that was a hard fought though but in the end OG is the new cham
"Ceb is a legend.  Coach for almost 2 years and a roster player for under 2 months.  His PMA is just what a ragtag new roster of amazing players needed for these comeback games time and time again.  Their whole tournament were comeback games, so the mental game was truly the most important thing for them."
Anyone from 2019?
ANA IS A FUCKING COLD BLOODED KILLER GOD DAMN! VIDEO BROUGHT ME TO TEARS. IM SO GLAD FOR OUR GAME.

If some of you guys still don't know the reference of that conversation (like me), check that video.
I Love it when Valve bring this up. Need 2 month after watching this I understand that reference. LUL.."

What arr they doing ? Feeding? Tapi malah mereka yang rata wkwkwk kontol kontol ngentot 50:22
"The whole team screaming and ana were like ""owh...ok..."""
Hahahahaha cao ni zhong gou
"Я в Доту не играю и вообще не понимаю смысла происходящего, но блин, как же круто!"

"""You're gonna see some shit man"" Oh boy, Ceb..."
"LGD FANS : GO HOME OG? 
OG : nope"
BEST GAME EVER
the chinese had too much ego.....they only thought they(chinese) the strongest team.
Can you send us LINK FOR DOWNLOAD of this VIDEO? I must show for my family
ana make plays with 0 emotions xD
No clue how to play DOTA no clue what the DOTA pro scene is like. But why are my eyes raining
Good job valve really good video ti ever
Notail is the brilliant player of all time
Last game: never celebrate too early LGD OMEGALUL
Rip for those 998 disliked by chinese
"I have watched this video so many times. As a fan and player of dota, you can appreciate the beauty of the game. Valve gave us a gem and the community polished it the way it is. Internationals have shown the struggle and evolution of the game brought up by constant patches. I can say that this game is made with passion. I love the way true sight show the raw experience of eSports, in all its dirt and glory."
OG is underdog no more!!!! the power of hardwork and friendship makes them a champ!!!!
JerAx : MAN UP... MAN UP GUYS !!!!
what the gay...
"I dont know but i really dont want chinese teams to win every championship, i just really dont want their auras and they dont even laugh and smile. I think thats the reason why chinese teams cant win championships coz they take the game so serious. No hate just opinion."
se.
Go home OG yes they will go home with the aegis karma bros!
Any chance there will be a True Sight on the OG Vs EG match?
"why is PL a Prob on lvl25? 
*pls enlighten me* 
I've only played dota not 2 and idk use PL"
I need the damn music used in this documentary :<
thats a no smoking area haha 17:39
I like how OG are chilled with picks letting each of them decide what they want.
The name of the music at 7:15 if it even is published
I don't know why but this thing almost made me cry
the best true sight i really respected CEB
"LGD loses: They picked a cheese strat, they're messy, they're dumbasses.
OG loses: We gotta play better, didn't come out of the lanes well.

But sure, voice lanes (that noone hears, because everyone mutes anyways) are disrespectful.
It's the difference between a winning and a losing mentality. Blame yourself and get stronger or blame others and be unable to handle defeat."
Talk to Kuro!
Ceb is such amazing guy.
Ti9 is coming
55:10 my idol a humble man. Picture of humble man one step away for hs lifetime wish achievement
Which shoulder is it man?? Savage
This is just fucking beautiful
47:37
"Как же жалко FY, божественный игрок!!!"
"LGD completely underestimated the power of notes and doing your homework on the other team's strats. Maybe as well as just having a good time and ""smiling and laughing"""
@18:18 what are those pills they are taking?
What does notail say at 12:35 in French after saying we are on edge? I’m going crazy
Damn I watched it for like 10 times already. Still got the chills.
dat beat from 0:50 to 1:10 fucking loved it <3 got me all pumped! lool
So much respect for ceb since the  major true sight
Ceb definitely was the mental MVP but damn Ana was the goat no doubt
38:24 all open mouth
Seeking For the Sound Track of @7:13 @37:28
am crying ;_;
"14:45 ""Kunkkaa"" -Somnus"
i get goosebumps every time the video hits animation God I'm so glad i was born in this era .
Notail breaks the no smoking sign
WHO WIN THe prize?
I watched this 3 times.
39:05 Ana is da best!
These fucking animations are dope
"I actually just found this awesome game, very similar to Dota 2. If you guys are interested,
can check it out here. The game name is called Ancient Creed.
Link: https://apple.co/2T7SyGJ
GP link: https://bit.ly/2E50AXh"
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW GOOD ANNA WAS UNTIL I SAW THIS. ALTHOUGH BIG PLAYS ARE COMING FROM THE SUPPORT BUT ANNA'S CONSISTENCY BROUGHT HOME THE BACON.
OG Fuck.... .-.
Why I only saw this now? man this brought back my goosebumps. Good production
BEST MOVIE 2019
btec league
Make this into an anime
Beaucoup trop stylé... même quand on ne joue pas a dota mais qu'on regarde la compétition tout les ans !
"after watching this I realise that OG really positive and enjoy whether they win or not. and just play the best as they can. its different from LGD, when they lost. the 4th game they already lost their spirit, they're also salty as hell. I hate them after watch this. LGD = SALTY AF, OG = Positive af. Congrats OG!!"
this documentation touched me 😭😭
I guess we're got 971 NoTail haters here. lol
"Watch it twice, cry twice.. gg OG"
"judging from their teamspeak, all i can say is..LGD underestimated OG for sure in game 5."
Dang. I’d pay to watch this on a moviehouse. Very good production. Honestly makes me wanna start playing dota 2 again
They invade alot of the guys privacy............... other than that good series
Ana respect my sensei
Really just 51:45 ame in frame?
Seeking FOr sound track
man ana is soooo weird
"after watch this, i want to be Ceb, especially Ceb spirit, very positive and motivate."
LUL instead of drafting smart and taking notes they were paying attention to OG and their gestures and the fact ceb was looking at his notes. That is why they lost.
Their all humble that's why they won....OG good game
"I respect LGD’s determination and all, but man they too salty. I’m asian yet I don’t want them to win in the first place. My heart goes out to OG specially to notail who lost most of their power lineups like miracle- yet managed to comeback and won ti8"
Sad chino
LGD.Paris go home! You'll never win OG deserved an aegis
What language at 12.30 ? We are on edge?
"""GO HOME OG"""
แซดกับโนเมลรักกันมาก  ให้กำลังใจกันตลอด  OG รักกันเข้าใจกันกอดตับมือไม่ว่าจะแพ้ชนะเค้ายังอยุ่เคียงข้างกันเสอม  แอนนา  ทอปสัน เจแหลก  แซด   โนเทล  ผู้ไม้ทิ้งศรัธาในตัวเองสู้ทุกสิ่งที่เค้ามี  สุดๆOG
"48:12 the probability chance winning for OG is 11% with score like that and LGD have 5k advantages when the moral team is going down, the true leader is Ceb when he motivated ana and everybody else that Ember, Zeus, Nature Prophet can make change in late game. I love him when he try to convince ana to do best until the end. thats im not see influence of the leader in LGD team when theie moral team down"
Oppa oppa boyd
“....Yohan Prophet anybody? “ HAHAHHAH
Where's the TUSK KING THE LGD SAYS?
Awesome
18:20 what is that?
U did well FY TwT @55:36
"I love how calm LGD is all the time, whether they won or lost. That deserves respect"
45:07 they have huge 3D projections when picking characters!?
"I don't like this game, never played it, never planned to watch a tournament of it and probably never will but the person who edited this video made a fun video."

what were LGD taking? were they really taking enhancement drugs?? is that legal?
直到今天才看这个，真的难受。GGWP
Anyone notice the robot that holding a paper says “bring OpenAI back” 😂
"Этот ролик просто лучший что я смотрел за все время , он показывает совсем другую сторону..... незабываемые эмоции и ощущения, спасибо!"
Thats why we love dota !! Fuck LOL
The last part tho <3 :'(
Love
WHY I CAN’T STOP WATCHING THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN???
Does anyone know what ceb tells on 12:29 in French (the original text plz)?
"7:14 - What music is that?"
29:49  she's very beautiful
"what a masterpiece, holy fuck.."
The PSG.LGD coach just like overly confident and trash talk on OG.. serve you in the face. Well play btw

"I like Ceb ""we are getting tested,we can't win that easy"" and liquid win 3-0 ti7 :))"
Go home lgd
00:45 music ?
"LGD lack of leadership. They are too worried to lose. And they lose. Basically like what notail said. ""Mental game""."
@14:45 kuunn caaaaa
I love OG
"14:40 That sweet, sweet _Kunkkaaaaaaaaaaa._"
those chinese so LOL..they think so ez..kids its like you get lamborghini but hotwheels LOLLOLLOLLOL so arogant.
"55:36  Me at home , when 31 december  at 23;59  o'clock :D"
Are they trying to pick the hero who beat them?
I just notice this red team especially the one with glasses is trying to act cool and tough in front of camera..
china no 2..hahaha
i miss Ana right now
VALVE PLEASE DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS ON CSGO.
"why this game so emotional, best moment ever"
"I dont get the hate OG is getting nowadays when they have ""fallen off"". I dont think these people understand the kind of preparation and work teams put in before the biggest tournament of the year. Imagine yourself winning millions of dollars after burning yourself out on your favorite game. Would you keep playing so much that you finally get tired of it or would you take it slow and keep the income rolling while having fun? Im not even an OG fan nor do I really care who wins but to blame all the TI winners for falling off is actually retarded. 
I would say the top 100 players are very close to each other in skill level but it all comes down to what other 4 people work best together and what patch suits them best. Not a single player has won 2 Internationals yet so I think that says alot."
LGD is fucking trash talk ego bitches
"FUCKING GOOSEBUMPS,,, DAMN I LOVE THIS,,, WATCHED MORE THAN 20 TIMES XD,,,,20 HRS WASTED SUCCESSFULLY HAHA"
chalice and maybe trashtalk  too much !!!
Very impressive game!

Nerd team vs chaonima team XD
I ve watched this 5 times now and i can't stop.
Tell me what kind of music is playing 0:48 ??

"Ceb such a badass ""you're gonna see some shit"" lmao calling his own insane plays before the game"
"He dare pick Axe in front of a Tusk king

how can ana face be so relax?
"i'm an asian, but somehow i can't help but think that the antagonist one is the chinese team..."
when lgd fans chants go home o.g i feel bad for them hahahaha
is ame's camera shutdown? he played some key play but his face was never shown exclusively during the game
Is the og asian guy talking to red asain guy?
"ВАУ! Спасибо! Целый цельный фильм. Сейчас, в феврале 2019 года, я будто снова попал в лето 2018 года. Великолепие, еще раз спасибо."

If this is your first time seeing topson play I'd go watch more gameplay. The dude is a boss and this doesn't do him justice"

"Other MOBAs have ranked roles free, why make this function paid? in what logic one should pay for this feature if instead, they could've made tutorial better with pro guides by hiring professional coaches or making videos by segregating them by naming each and every guide made by a different coach having their own guide in 

their style or by their perspective so what will happen is if containing a bundle of these video guides/tutorials or whatever you'd like to name/call it in the plus so new players could've gotten introduced to DotA even more and didn't quit it by experiencing terrible community who 

knows about the game and expects others to have that knowledge as well, these kinda things leads newbies to quit DotA instantly and play other game instead, obviously they're missing the depth of the game here or immersive knowledge or fresh experience offered by Valve's weekly or daily patches which keeps game more interesting and more challenging for any mind. Dota is sick by no means.  

Instead of trying something new they just updated the UI and added new sets, pretty ignorant plus is trash instead bring back seasonal battle passes some people are ready to pay more if it 

comes to that but this shit nope plus is trash, with the battle pass and new skins they could've gotten more player base since players love getting new skins even fortnut is doing same stunts bps. either Add this videos or some new function, I mean you don't have to make coaching guides free either, make them paid some players are even willing to pay even more 

and plus since coaching shouldn't be free in the first place, players will like for an example 'X' coaches video more than 'A' coaches videos so they'll pay more for that service or like any other cosmetic in game X coaches guide will more likely is labelled with a greater price. And why one should use something Game Leap or any other third party sites for this obvious I don't know a trick? perhaps you should call it or this coaching stuff just add it in DotA plus, ad it may affect player base in a positive way."
ЫЫЫ
"who here is switching from Lol to Dota after watching this, or at least giving Doto a try now after watching this? <<<<<<<<<<<< thumbs up if you are switching over/trying out Doto"
"Love these 2 goons interaction with each other espeically on Game 4

"Ceb : we're not on timing this game, this is zeus late game, ember late game, magnus late game, remember!
starting from 50:25 - 55:18 is the answer to what the Ceb said :)"
Can someone explain the part at 25:19 where the guy asks somnus to take off his jacket if they win?
"I came rewatch this and the last part got me teary eyed, I was flooded by goosebumps"
Topson: ehhhh I think I like sauce... 46:08
Финал достоин внимания! Поистине фантастический финал с многочисленными переворотами. Один из лучших финалов The International!
I wonder what's somnus eating b4 match. anybody knows?
"Как же они любят бананы:DDD. И очень ключевую роль в предпоследней игре сыграло то что морф превращался в лансера и собирая итемы на лансера, но не в этом суть суть в том что между превращениями на тот момент морф терял ловкость потерял около 60-70 ловкости вроде это было багом на следующий же день его пофиксили."
"im a league of legend player but this video is so clean and beautiful 
fucking proud of dota2 community"
14:48 KUNKKA!!!
Now.. Who r OG without Ana?.
Why Ana always look panic ans stressed lol

OG[OriginalGangster] hehehehe
"This is so amusing but sad at same time.
I dont give a fuck whoever won TI, its chinese or american or others. We need a good teamfight maybe a best teamfight to show the world. Are you still cheering for dota or your nation? Choose your poison."
Y can't dota have music videos..awaken and rise are too op for that shitty LoL

Never been more satisfying when LGD lose
57:52 sucks to be the cameraman on the losing team I think
if the bug with agility on morph did not have...maybe LGD go home with 11m of green
everything can work
"Нечего не хочу сказать против OG, Но это просто везение! LGD очень сильная команда и по праву заслуживает победы, А OG тупо тянут игру как могут, A LGD играют открыто, и наносят удары фатально! Спасибо за TI, LGD, вы все равно лучшее!"
No war! Play Dota!
12:41 only true for chinese teams :)
Nice video indeed❤😭
"17:50 This face really pround, When u get one point after u lose at first ..and want to show how u feeling to those enemy lol"
this is dope!
12:42 hahaha good statistics.
"some said 14:45 is the most badass somnus moment, but i think it's 12:10 i can feel the pressure and his 'boss' aura man"
anyone know what those vitamin thing lgd were eating??
OG played out of their minds and was so deserving but it hurts so bad to see fy lose another grand finals. He is the one I want to win a TI the most.
Mobile Legends the best!
Is it me or there are only 4 Chinese players shown :D
What a good start of TI atmosphere
57:00 Sh*t i always feel goosebumps! The most underrated Team wins the TI8 And they deserved it! ❤
kunkkkaaaa I had goosebumps
"i really love how Maybe pronounce ""Kunkka"" 14:46 😂"
"Before the final,  i heard a lot of bad word to OG.
Dude , they deserves the win! Look at their attitude! Look at ceb !! Did PSGLGD had a leader like him???

and, topson , what a legend .
TI8 is his  offically FIRST tournament of his life.
He won it.. JESUS CHRIST"
I feel like Ceb's was the reason OG won. He allowed the rookies to play their best and covered them in the game in and emotionally.
"holy shit 
ceb!!!The greatest leader

really good attitude!!"
True Sight: The team with plain jersey  vs the team with jersey full of sponsors :v
14:45 Kunkkaaaaaaaa
14:45 villain somnus. Thank me later.
Only in True Sight can you cheer for the team that won and feel so bad for the team that lost. True Sight TI7 was also this.
"Ceb is a good player and motivator, he deserved it."
It was the best TI of all the time.
52:57 BEST DOTA MEME OF ALL TIME LOL
Kunkkaaaaa!!!

"I'll be waiting, coz someday filipinos will play in TI and the Philippines will go crazy,"

They should have a lot of animations about the tournaments.
"Dear Valve, please do this for every series of TI8... This is for the growth of Dota 2. Read this. Without these stories and in depth views of the players and how they play, think, and live Dota, Dota cannot possibly grow. In my own channel, I tell stories to not only glorify this sport, but also help it grow. I wish to See Dota, one day, compete with NBA, Futbal, or any other sport. Dota has the potential to grow, so please do not contain it , or limit it. Be adventurous and push its boundaries. Show us the beauty of it. Perhaps create more True sight stories from other major tournaments? We want Dota to Grow. Anyways thanks, and i hope to see more great things."
Is there a true sight video for chongqing major??
what camera and lens do they use

"I wanna learn french dude  , I didn't understand what Ceb saids :("
36:33  That moment when you get pissed and your team needs you badly.
I really have to give some credit to xNova. Maybe im just being a Singaporean and bias but i  felt like he work really hard from a country with such limited exposure and opportunity. He went to China alone in search of opportunity and manage to make it to the grand final of TI8. Humble yet excellent.

Hands down the best True Sight video!!! So many goosebumps moment...
"You pick what you feel like fucking them with...

kunkkaaa
14:46 kunkka
where's Ame lol
"Somnus, ""Kunkkaa.."""
Topson is so socialy awkward it's not even funny . . .
14:46 menacing.....
"Did anyone cried when the game end and LGD Fy sat in a motionless yet full emotion of experiencing tha pain of losing. You all watch and cheers at the end for OG. But LGD being the better team and losing it...damn eventhough I aint a fan of LGD, they surely are better team. OG Notail I am so hapoy for u beyond words can explain"
Wow i was so invested in this. Didnt know i was watching for a full hour till it was finished. Great work on this masterpiece!
Fuck China
14:48 kunkka lmao
I love OG´s team spirit! What a fantasitc team!
what are the Chinese disgusted with their behavior
Не показали мув аны как он продал шмотки= хуета
Lol too much trash talk
I LOVE this game! LOOOOOOOOOOVE IT!
Cannot watch this after 26:44 as a LGD fan but well made series I love it!!!!!!!
"Last draft was the best, they picked heroes what they want with their hearts."
ODpixel is a good caster. But i really wished it was tobi who casted the grand finals. It would have been more epic.
Shit this china guys have no respect
Please release the music on it's own! I'm begging you!
"7uckingmad and N0tail have so much positive energy man, even when on the back foot."
"ODPixel deserved this so much, I'm proud of him"
who ever did this film TY!!!
lets go play dota auto chess broo !!
"VALVE, PLEASE, DO A TRUE SIGHT ABOUT CSGO!!! THUMBS UP SO THEY CAN SEE IT <3"
"Unpopular oppinion here:
Kind of hate how biased the editing of this whole thing is.
Nice dramatic movie, but a bad documentary,  which is a real shame, because LGD are real people too and are every bit as deserving (maybe even more) to be in the finals as OG, despite being portrayed as emotionless foils for ""the heroes"" to overcome."
"Man, these LGD kids were incredibly arrogant and condescending.. they focussed on gazing over into the other booth and talking shit about the enemy team.. that's why they lost. Pathetic attitudes"
59:56 song plsssssssss!!! <3
40:30 wtf Ceb ? did u just use doppleganger ???
"i've been playing together with one of the player from PSG.LGD at RGC, we were tournament together, and i didn't expect that he's a professional player right now, really proud of you my brother, nothing is impossible if you work hard!!"
This shit gives chills FFS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Me Mid & 2 tango & 1 ward Ty
please make the next true sight 1 hour or more too
looking at the overconfidence in lgd just made me so happy that OG won haha
What is the background music on 42:00 ?
50:42 even that guy in the back is shocked and relieved.
"I dont want to offend, im just curious. But whenever lgd talks about certain hero(im reading subtitles) i dont hear them saying its name. Please explain or do they have chinese name for all of those heroes?"
"When LGD fans think their won.
XD"
"best video game ever, best esport tournament ever, best TI/coverage EVAAAAA!"
"трек в студию пжлст

I see fy is same as sumiya
ABC Kids shows.....represent BoxHill/MontAlbert bro. doing it for station st.
"I'm a Chinese DoTA fan and I'm a girl. OG is a great team but watching this video makes me cry EVERY SINGLE TIME. Especially around 55:36 onwards. It's heart-wrenching to see the look on FY's face. All my male friends don't even have the slightest thought of watching this. It'll forever be a pain in all our hearts. 
No matter how many times we watch the same thing, over and over again, the ending will still be the same. And yes, we lost......"
"So intense, so emotional, this is just too good for a ""documenter"" what your team doing is like a movie! This turned everything dota is dead game way out"
I was there and it was one of the best moments of my life. DOTA FOREVER!
arrogant psg lgd lol...
"CROWD(LGD fans): Go home OG! Go home OG!
OG: Are there any flies making sound?"
Anyone knows what ceb was cursing?
OST of Interstellar? Please.
Music at 42:22?
Kooonkhaaaa
Which Shoulder is it?  Cr1t- didn't even do enough damage to make Johan remember which shoulder he hit.  *facepalm*
"This is what we called Humility. If you are not humble enough, bad luck will comes to you. FY and Chalice Sommnus dont deserved a title they were so arrogant. Sad to Ame and Xnova, they dont deserve a team like this. I hope they will team up with newbee. They really dont deserve to win. Im happy that they'll lose to EG right now. Chongqing
Truely God exist! ❤
Sorry for bad english. 
MR: Grammar"
Only me remembered Kiev major?

This is the best True Sight since the fucking emotional Alliance vs Na'vi finals!!! Just re-watched right now. Best e-sport ever!!!
why didnt they include ana selling half of his battlefury to have buyback in this true sight?
"CEB : Win or lose bois, just have fun and do your best.  
QQQ : You lost because noone went to Roshan.

Totally different ideas on what being a leader is"
The Best True sight omg full of goose bumps
They Win Ti 9. While me : making useless dota 2 videos :(
Tusk king have left the chat
"37:32 
Jerax: ana? Are you gonna relo to the base?

So after football messi is now working on valve as an observer?
".............

22:27 pls Tell me the name of the soundtrack !!!
The songs used in this video who knows?
OG Well done. Never give up. We will wait for new shows
43:00 when you played more dota than a TI champion and didn't won a penny in the process
Ana is the most humble player i've ever seen
"""Im ready to lose, Im ready to wim, im ready for fucking everything"""
"12:41 ""team that won game 1 always lose the finals"" well, i dont know. Go talk to liquid"
amazing video <3
"lmao the face of those disappointed Chinese fans....
Well deserved for unsportsmanship and disgusting people just like their country"
the chinese subs is real or just fake? they making them cocky lol
INDO PLEASE!!!!!!!
Lunger cancer will be an popular problem in near future for old dota players and staff lol.
Topson just won ti for some reason he get fucked every games LOL
"not sure why they didn't include ana echo slam dodge, that was a highlight"
Dang look at that dude at 39:43 w/ that active windbreaker #lookinlikeasnack
"2:43 oh shit camera, promise i was working."
LGD is too superstitious and became too arrogant
Is seb a coach or he play?
since when invoker's tornade had a health bar ?
Ceb is the real mvp
Am I the only one with goosebumps in that axe buyback
B O R I N G
I love DOTA 2
I'm already at the point where I remember everything everyone said in this video.
"CEB IS SO AMAZING AT BEING A CALM AND EMOTIONAL LEADER  AT THE SAME TIME, HE MADE THIS FILM SO GREAT BY HIMSELF"
"27:55 ""This migth be the axe game"" Almost prophetic"
How can you compare this masterpiece game to league of lesbians?
What are they eating? 18:21?
7:40 song?
"This is a good team, win or die they dont care. Just enjoy the game and to the draft dont push your player to play a hero not fit to them.CEB is MVP in critical situation CEB is stay calm down and still support their team. And Pick the best hero and ENJOY THE GAME!!!"
O.G win my Heart
BOOMB!!!
"52:05 ""Man up guys, f*cking man up"" loved that part. :D"
Like it when N0tail smokes at a non-smoking SIGN .
love dota2 I indonesia
Notail played for way too long for this moment...
"Всегда болел за нотейла,еще со времен фнатик,он достоин быть чемпионом,он прошел огромный путь , безгранично рад за него"
Это намного эпичнее чем клипы лиги легенд!
"49:49 ""Johan Prophet, anybody?"" ROFL"
chinese people toxic irl and in game hate their noise too much lmao
OG gonna to lose in round 4 but OG never surrender and comeback
"The one who made this video deserve a portion of that $11,000,000.00!!"
35:58 PL ana animation gives me goosebumps
30:58 mother fuckers!!! fuck you!!! HAHAHAHAHA
"24:28 Marlboro red yosi ni bigdaddy tapos paghipat niya sabi niya putang inang yosi to panis HAHAHAHAHA sinadya ko talaga magtagalog lang para mga kababayan ko lang na pinoy makaintindi ng comment ko
Hello mga pinoy HAHAHAHAHA"
LGD to talk so much then lose
Anyone know the OST for the melody they are playing when OG finally wins? o;
"I can’t even explain how proud I am of og,they deserved that victory"
Watch this for 20th time and still get excited and cried for their victoryy! Congrats OG 💖
"The chinese, still rude and proud even in pro scene lmao."
The special animated parts are cool and all but the actual footage would be much better.
OG won TI and ana is fucking chill AF! MVP of this series tho <3
"Chinese game doesn't use a single word in english ? Even when the translation is just them shouting AXE AXE AXE that's not what we hear at all, are all the heroes names different in chinese etc ?"
"Europe is just the most dominant region in esports thats all I can see, through game mechanics and mental attitude"
"what a job by the sound department, shit was epic!!"
"If fy will fuck me while whatever he's doing to me (including bdsm). I will say ""thank you, daddy""."
Everything is scripted
"*DOTA 2 IS SO FUCKING BEAUTIFUL*

*wipping my tears."
Best True Sight
i think the real captain in OG is Ceb.

"Every REAL dota 2 player after watching this will say ""Dota 2 is MORE than just a game"" :)."
Ceb is the best captain.
Fy deserve TI title. But OG is so awesome this year. Especially with their mindset no matter anything happen
"Watching FY just sit there as the fire works went off. Probably one of the most spine tingling moment of the whole video.
Mad respect to the man consistently playing at such a high level."
"What got me the most was the fucking end quote, he dreamt of it 2 years before he actually won it ."
59:45
"When maybe is asked what hero want to pick and said ""kunkka!"", it gave me chills. And for sure somebody will gonna be raped by his kunkka. 14:44"
"Jerax: Memes?
Ana: Fuck off."
OG wins because of their leader......
"Holy shit, LGD were so cocky and look what happened to them.Karma's a bitch."
30:56 the best of True Sight some spell in French
"Not sure why, but Ceb reminds me of ProfessoR from Money Heist."
This game made me a fan of Dota Esports can't wait till Ti9. Also I just realized Ceb is a god. From a coach to a TI champion. Lakad Matatag
Chinese team fight-good.
china sb
"Man, I cried so hard watching this TS.
I mean I cried because I feel so happy for OG. What an amazing display of trust and teamwork. And I also cried because I feel bad for LGD as well. 
Seriously, I really respect pro players, man, the pressure is freaking intense when it comes to pro scene match. 
Well done OG, and good luck LGD for this year TI. =)"
Какие же китайцы чсв...
Go home OG ? Hahah sad chinese choke
Ceb is holding a bunch of papers
that PSG LGD dude looks like ratata
I'm so emotional for OG right now.
"Can anyone tell what soundtrack is in this?:D would be really helpfull, the piano before and after last game :X"
"TI 7 and TI 8 its have a same condition,  when china feel win early  game, and throw ez  game in the last.. God Damn !!!!"
caralho mano esses chineses são muito feios  ahhahahahahahahahahahha!
OG were resilience in the face of adversity nuff said....
12:29 what language?
"I didn't care for PSG.LGD when I watched TI Final but damn, watching this makes it heartbreaking. Respect for both teams, TI3 and TI8 are two of my favorite TI Finals."
59:30 bigdaddy.. i can understand the unxeplain emotional from hugging that TI Aegis.. go home my hero enjoy the win and get some rest. U just work n thingking this shit too much.
Topson is stupid player
this best true sight {but the phoenix is good play}
Man.. sure makes you jealous of those kids. I wish i could be part of that world..
True Sight : The International 2018 Finals - A documentary about smokers that play some dota between cigarettes.

17:41 no smoking sign at the back
"Me after watching this True Sight: 41:49

The hype is real"
"Comparing with last years True Sight, we can clearly see the big difference between Newbie and PSG-LGD. PSG-LDG has a way better team spirit."
55:17 I want a loop of this sadness 😂
28:15 meme
"YES, this is the best true sight.
thx"

"Dota2 its like ... love, means a lot for me. I have 8k hours in dota2 5.2k mmr, im from argentina and i play in brasil server  (compared to this guys i suck dick), but valve need change something on mediocre bracket, i leaved dota2 i cannot play anymore, i get a lot of fun watching high level leagues, but i literally cannot play dota2 anymore Brasil servers are just fucked, NA servers are a bit better but not much better (160ms in NA is hard too). Its like i love dota, and i hate dota at the same time. Just maybe the problem its not the game, people are the problem"
why my heart stomp so hurt just by watching this recap :S
"This is some serious mental shit than LoL. I bet winning the international is like the best thing ever since the game is hard to master, imagine how many games they played. Im impressed. Gonna give the game a try."
who's the real loser here? Fly
"LGD, good luck! all the best!"

Ебать шедевр! OG сделали невозможное! Так рад за Йохана! Прям слезу пустил после истории с Fly
"pulling a SFM on CEB's best call was a bad move imo, i really wanted to see it :("
Переживал как за своих детей.Очень эмоциональный True Sight получился
This deserve an Oscar
Now I know why the camera is there😂
Respect from Russia
LGD play by the book while OG play from their HEART
Guys any ideas whats the song from 47:20?? It sounds amazing
"How much i hate OG as an EG fangays, but i have to give to ceb! He can make a fuxking cat into a tiger.. Positives positives and positives.. Always thinking about the team nothing else.

Ps:- Chalice fucked a lot of decision this game especially last game roshan call.. Everybody was sceptical but chalice thinks he really good..

Wp CEB and OG"
Man I think LGD just too cocky and don't give enought respect to OG tho. Lose to themself
Tusk King ? JUST MYTH!
"VALVE CAN YOU PLEASE RELEASE THE SOUNDTRACK FOR THIS!!!!

The Documentary is incredible, btw."
what a moment ! thanks for that
"Jerax: Ana, can you tell if they rupture you? Cause I think you'll get fucked, and I'll reloc you, I'll try.
Ana: ...
Jerax: Ana?
Ana: Sorry?
Jerax: Say if you get ruptured because then I wanna reloc you out.
Ana: Yeah sure..
Jerax: That's the only thing I care about.
Ana: I mean I don't even know what the fuck's going on. I can't even see my own hero.
39:04"
I cried in the ending part 😞💕 I love it! Gratsssss OG🎉
"valve, can you give us more than this? 
I know this ""true sight"" is so good, but I need more, please"
People who disliked this video is probably LOL player.
"After watching this TI8's True sight,  I thought of 
""Serves them right for these Chinese cunts being cocky just taking the game 2 & 3!"" Those attitudes are not for champs. Glad they didn't win this TI. 

For OG, props to all of them specially Ceb and Notail for leading the team. They truly deserve this."
the best gaming related thing I have ever watched
"Od pixel was a magic caster , he is amazing"
What is this
"Ceb switched from coach to player? Looks like he's still the coach to me, not sure who that other guy who hangs out in the booth with them is."
wow 86k likes
i feel sorry for LGD's fans.... their reactions made me cry huhu
"guys , win or lose , we don't care , we play !"
"'Not too long ago I was watching ABC fucking kids shows... and now I'm here'.

Lol, Ana is such a weirdo. He's so good though."
"What an absolute throw on game 4, unbelievable. Can't believe O.G won ti8, certainly should not have happened. The 4th game is so cringe."
never seen Dota 2 Played and Strategised this Intensely
bet losers counted 817 now
4:22 souprice
"fave parts!! 1. ana: i dont even know what the fucks going on, i cant even see my own hero... 2. chalice: what are they doing? feeding?.... 3.  somnus: kuunkaaa"
I never bored to watch this TS .. really really incridible 🔥
31:04 how jerax laugh at the curses lol
"and they said VP are toxic? XD lol 
gg wp OG you was better thats why you are champs. But what now? TI curse? GL in further but not against bears"
"One important thing i obeserved at both teams r quite big different. Og after everygame they evaluate their recent games verbally through encouragement. On the other hand psglgd failed to do so, theyre more serious and not encouraging everyone or mainly inspiring their own teammates. That is how things should be."
why china always lose
"they break the curse , i hope sea got this aegis someday"
donde esta el subtitulo en español??
Ceb's positive mindset is so powerful.
17:36 Am I the only one that notices the no smoking sign while n0tail is smoking. Lol
This is the second movie that made me cry like a fucking kid
сука да слёз...
Awesome!!!!
Admit it. Newbee get better mental attitude than LGD. When they lose newbee was heartbroken but their manager maybe(the girl) say something i wanna hear when I get down.
不bb 我们LGD是不可战胜的
could someone tell me what is the song name at 47:33 its so fvcking amazing
"7ckingmad, i truly respect this guy. strong mentality, positive attitude, leader quality."
"почему-то не вижу комментов на русском, украинском и других адекватных языках"
39:11 Ana cant see his own hero memes if anyone is looking for it :D
im no OG fan but honestly they kinda deserved to win
"What impresses me most about Ana is that he always plays his best dota when it really matters. Under pressure, he's the best."
Next level overthinking HAHAH
GO HOME LGD
14.46
"看完了True Sight在心疼一波Maybe FY AME Charlice Xnova。虽然在现场 很失望，但是当时更加心疼LGD。上海加油！
我们已经经历过这次，没有什么能阻挡我们了"
A+ watching it live
Красиво
modern day Cinderella story...... OG
what  the fuck si sommus eating?
someone give me name of the song 7:20
"dammit i feel sad whenever i see fy trying so hard to be positive until the last match for his teammates, but i guess they don't really care"
PSG.LGD will never win a TI no Matter the roster
"29:38
Topson : Oh my god(no hope)
Ceb : Don't worry, Topias, focus, stay strong. We're gonna fuck him, don't worry about it. I,ll destroy him, I'll destroy him. 

guess what, he really did. 👏"
Damn onions
"If you ask me, the most important takeaway from this TI and from OG ... 
you don’t have to toxic to be good at dota.

Flowers and friendship boys."
Poor PSG.LGD BibleThump
Man the animation is so good. Especially the axe jumping for the call. Best true sight so far. Good job !
"Need the previous TIs.
Chinese Team be the villain again, just like TI1 and TI7. I feel so sad for FY when retro this TI, but can't blame LGD tho. They got tremendous pressure from all Chinese DOTA2 fans. And I didn't even know about Ceb before, very well done. I so fkin love this game, will never touch LOL again."
The best part was at the very end of the video *cries*
799 dislike from bitter chikwas hahaha
what i can see that lgd is the same with newbee in ti7 because they only focus on how to counter the enemy heroes rather than thinking about how to make their own game better and that's why they lose. Btw is a good game and both team really did good but og has to be a better team in that day.

"Ceb/7ckngMad:

""Okay I can tell you their strat, their strat is: ""if we don't hardcore counter-pick him mid, and like, put 20 denies on his face in 4 mins, we fucking get destroyed, like in 10 mins, or we just can't play.""

This is their strat. Y'know? but fuck it, this is not gonna work. 

First of all, we can play around it in the draft, and second of all, whatever they think is fucking bullshit, y'know, and this game proves it. 


So, actually, i think they're really confused, they just trying to fuckin', they're just trying to give Maybe a good game, and give Topias a bad game, because they think this is the only way they can win, this is my take.
 

First of all, this is not the only way they can win, and second of all, they're not going to get it.""

True understanding of the game. Compared to Chinese players in general."

"Ceb, n0tail, JerAx and ana have 2 already in true sight, it's beautiful"
"It's my 4th time watching this True Sight and every time I finished this video it satisfy me knowing that Fly never had a chance to win TI. 

Fly : I felt like we kinda hit a dead end and yet I want to win and I wanna do it with teammates I believe in.

Guess what Fly you're the one who's letting OG hit the dead end because 
"" The dead end for OG in this TI is holding the aegis and you're not even close to touching it ""

Kudos to Fly btw for making it to EG's line up

And also the life is like that. When everything comes up to you, you got to carry over all the pressure and keep going. No matter win or lose. Just, keep going."
Ppasarel le-a dat mucu' la orezari :D
LEGENDARY RESPECT
31:00 best part when Ceb and Notail start cursing in French and Jerax can't hold his laugh
29:49 wife material
Ceb is the real MVP
700+ dislikes from China~
"After playing dota for like 12+ years of my life, I finally went to my first TI this year. I remember cheering for n0tail back in the HoN days when he was a hotshot mid on soulstealer. To witness it all in person, I was brought to tears multiple times (starting with the EG series). This documentary brought back all those feelings and then some. Incredible watch, well done, gg wp OG and LGD. dota2forever"
I love Ceb's positive mental attitude. Fvck that! 💖
Dota is the greatest e-sport game ever. No other game can come close to the clutch plays and the excitement. I just wish valve pushed the game more so we could have it for another 10 years.
14:45 kunkka
"55:45 he's like""I'll go eat a banana after this."""
Solid OG!💖👊🏻....I feel you LGD 😢

why lol channel have 10m subscribers and dota2 not even 1m.? :(
"in terms of skill wise LGD is way way better than OG but god damn the chemistry, the leadership and the trust in each other that OG showed. Fuck! Ceb is fucking MVP he shows how to be a good and effective leader.. He trust his team mates because of that OG has lower pressure than LGD .. Ceb real MVP"
seb.. what a goddam leader
I lost my job watching this series. No regrets at all.

Kunkka : ""Kunkka"" is my name"
"39:15 this is every fckin war
54:31 - 54:34 TTSSKKKKKK"
The silence on LGD's end gives me life. Especially when the fireworks are going off.
37:28 When you risk 11 million dollars for memes.
cheer up china.y can do it.be stronger.
"Why OG is BETTER? Positive mentality, Patience, Perseverance and most importantly THEY ADMIT MISTAKES AND LET MISTAKES AS AN ASSET!"
chinese big head thats why
Damn these onions.
700 people who disliked this video probably lost the bet against OG
Subtitled?
China suck self throwing game3 stupid
part 2 please.
The last word that notail said is very dramatic and his dream come truth😢
That is really2 awesome
"the music on the begining of first game 4:15, SO EPIC"
the fucking ultimate underdogs. everyone doubted OG. but they are so positive. they play the game as they enjoy it!
14:45 GOOSEBUMPS
"GO HOME OG

After that, I’m so glad they won."
"Ceb: ""Yeah, this is some next level overthinking from them, I feel bad for them""
Also Ceb: ""Whatever, I don't feel bad for them, Fuck 'em""

OHH CEBB XD"
"38:39
thank me later"
"The moment when Maybe said ""Kunkka"" at 14:45 min mark sounds like a voice from a horror movie. Kunkkaaaaaaaaa🤣"
WHERE'S AXE?????????
"Ceb reminds me of Loda. Very positive, Mindset and heart of a champion. Difference between them? Ceb is carrying and sweet unlike Loda, He was Salty. Bigdaddy won The international! From losing his best buddy to winning an Aegies. 15000 hours of playing dota paid off. Well Ana is like Puppey. Very Calm, Precise and firm. Jerax, Thank you for being savage to almost everybody this proves that carry ain't shit without supports, SEA server take notes. Topson, Not that vocal but focused his teamates did not made him feel his off and he is productive providing that 20% out of 100% of the team.  ""Never underestimate a heart of a champion"" 

Mr. Editor, Thank you.

Play with me I'll support 325364358 :)"
"let's mute them, guys. FY ""block the user"" hahahahahaahahaha"
"I'm not crying, you're crying! ;)"
"14:05 i feel bad for them. Whatever, i dont feel bad for them, fuck em😂😂"
Very good valve!!!!
jerax kept notil in check :)
they should do a 3-hour movie like Infinity War or something. open qualifiers scum to the champions of the WORLD.
Disliked by LGD crew ^)^
OG's 6th man/Hype man should also have lapel microphone. I really felt his effort on this grand final. That dude needs some recognition.
OG PULLED OFF THE MOST EPIC COMEBACKS NOT EVEN AGAINST LGD BUT WITH OTHER TEAMS AS WELL!  They play it safe early came and comeback late game WP OG!
14:45
incredible. thank you.
"the team styles are soo different, and as an occidental, is really dificult to empathize with the asian team, the coach is in some ways gross."
"I ve been a dota player, all my life. Its the only game i play for the last 9 years of my life(i am 27). I cant thank valve enough for what has done for the best FREE to play game and prolly the best/hardest teamplay game ever made(Props to Icefrog) 
The only thing i am sad about is that the community is not growing, its not that we lose lots of players, its that we are all old now and we play less and less. We are all mostly veterans now. You hardly find new players playing dota 2. And i blame valve on this one. All these years and i have never seen an advertisment to play dota 2. You can browse anywhere in the internet and find LOL adds, or adds for other games. Why doesnt valve focus on advertising the game ? It will be just a fraction of their millions they made out of dota 2 which will pay back from skins purchases from new players. 
VALVE PLEASE. MAKE SURE DOTA 2 WILL SURVIVE THROUGH THE YEARS . WE ARE GROWING OLD. WE NEED NEW BLOOD. THIS GAME HAS SO MANY POSSIBILITIES. IT CAN BE SO HUGE."
I wish they showed at least one play that Topson made in game 1. That was my favorite!
These finals bested TI3 for me...
Why just 1080p?
I think OG's mentality is overpower 🤘
"mentality was the key. OG played fun dota at game5, while LGD is being shaken up because of game4"
изи катка
"59:45  
I Strongly believe that 
if i woke up in the moring 
and i had to playy TI final 
i would play the best Dota of my life
that's all that would matter to me . 
if i played my very best  nothing else would matter.
RESPECT !!!"
Fy is handsome
A story of teamwork and friendship..

"When fans of lgd said

12:58 looks like good opening :D
"LGD didn't have a show of affection, of empathy with its own companions. OG is a real team, a TEAM."

Someone say rubick is not too strong lol
Who put onion here?
Amme first time seen 17:53
"Here's to the people that shouted ""GO HOME, OG"". Yes, they went home a champion."
LGD players didn't realize how badass spec is till the finals

"Guys,,win or lose we dont care,,lets play!! So fucking spirit for all team"
*го взаимную подписку)))оцените мои видео*
29:43 thats just Father-figure ceb right there. The confidence of a man to put weight to carry the whole team on his shoulder.
"52:01 the true confidence and trust of a teammate to each other, and also ceb accepting the fact that they already won everything that they possibly can. Actually before Game 1 even started he's ready win or lose,  but he wants to play all his best and give the fans a great match."
756 MOBILE LEGENDS AND LOL PLAYERS DISLIKING LOL
Ceb is fucking amazing  team leader
eaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa老子好不容易快忘了的
SPAM THIS 🌼 TO GIVE NOTAIL POWER!!!!
where is mobile legend player? XD
"CEB is a true leader of this game while Ana is a pro player, then jerax was some shit good support. So Organize Topson and n0tail is really good at gameplay they just have perfect team."
One year wonder...
"""I have 15.000 hours of dota. Whatever they have, I have more than them."" lmfao I'm dead. You know a player dedicated like this deserves to win"
"Who would win
CHINA.              Some scrawny white bois"

oh yeah yeah
WHover wanted to Pick BS lost PSg the series
"37:26 Jerax: Ana, you wanna Relo into the base? 
This guy has a lot of positivity😂😂😂"
Notail deserves it more than anyone.
"OG 🖤 dude they really deserved it. Im not saying lgd are not good, actually i think that lgd are better if we talk about skill, but if we talk about team comunication, mental setup, teamfights and comeback i think all know og is better at these things"
2:31 that sweatpants sellout...Making extra cash with fake jeans ad 💰
0:40 name of that song pls
Those edit ...
That kunkka really is powerhouse at mid specially in china server. That invo pick was too bold knowing the ups and downs of the hero without knowing that kunkka is open. Cause kunkka is the best mid hero well for me.
Best!!!
Why valve didnt make true sight of csgo whyyy
"What time did they say ""Dont give a fuck. The less fucks we give the better"""
Fy :c
am I the only one who is crying now?
41:45 I want sound before game5
"Jerax: ana want to get back to the base? 
Jerax: memes? 
Hahahaha jerax so laid back but is the unspoken hero of that series together with ana"
Should make a movie out of this ..good job
Good game
That comeback game is so intense!
Ana is the best on that TI i think
The pressure of each teams i can feel it
4:14 what soundtrack?
谢天谢地这里没有中国喷子
really watching 1 hours for this. too good
"""i dont knooooooo"" -TOPSON 2k18"
ANA!!
"""We don't care if we win or lose. We play.""

Ceb has an outstanding leadership skills... Pheonomenal matches. Extraordinary performances from both teams and what a magical movie. Kudos to the whole True sight team for making this happen... 🤘👏"
"I kinda dont like og but , i like this ceb guy he's positive guy"
it is awesome
THE EPIC DOTA BATTLE ON HISTORY!!!
you just can't beat Ceb when he's loaded with papers
Best TI! Damn!
THE BEST TRUE SIGHT!
The only thing that all chinese team does'nt has is belieave and power of friendship they always underestimated their against team
China №2
Lol too much smoke for team lgd
Is it just me or I feel like China players have a very bad attitude. I mean they are good but the sportsmanship wise... don't look good
7:24
Shitty retards looking braindead cant win a ti
Go ember.. go ember. -Ana
"No wonder LGD lost, the coach was truly awful! His guys just lost a game and he blames them for losing, with details about they didnt kill rosh or something. The player of lgd looked like he didnt even know, what he was talking about. 
No new motivation, encouragement or invoking teamspirit in there at all..."
Ana said.. pls stfu! I got this.
Dota is toxic as its pro player
LGD今年加油啊
bravo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Amazing journey!! I cryed when they won, i m crying now:) Wonderfull!!!! <3 Love OG"
I love Fy And I believe LGD can Win in Ti9
Arrogancy makes them lose.
С меня лайк хули
fucking beautiful cinematography !
GG OG
"rewatch it more than 5 times, still worth most of my times"
Oh how I wish CSGO would get this kind of attention from Valve...
34:05 WHO'S GONNA GO HOME NOW FUCKERY FUCKERS LOL
"A pure difference between the gameplay of Champs and non-champs. Kudos to the positivity of OG, an inspirational team for all aspiring dota 2 champs."
This is the most epic true sight
And some old guys asking me wtf is esports anyway? I'll show them this video.
"""Teams that win game 1 always lose the finals"" - that may be the TI curse"
It's such an amazing underdog story it's almost as if it was written by someone haha
2 YEARS IN A ROW 2 RANDOM PLAYERS WIN THEIR FIRST TEA EYE
"Just got a bag, picture and autograph from notail.!!!!😍😍😍"
Sound design is insane
BEAUTIFUL
ana bangsat betul
"LGD FANS: GO HOME OG!!

OG: No, you go home."
China NUMBAWAN!

The cinematic scenes are so freaking good! Props to the creators of the video.
LGD SO PRO
"@50:42 ""oooo shit Ana you're fuckin good maaaannnn"" -Jerax"
Matumbaman is happy and motivated.
FY-god(
Notail smokes????????
best TI !!!!
"OPPA! Now, I'm craving a banana. Thanks, 7ckngMad."
OG played really good and they stick together to the end and they deserve to win  ( : WP OG :)
GIVE THIS BOY THE INVOKER! HAHAAH
is it just me or is LGD's jokes are a little too arrogant?? OG's just doing their best and having fun but i cant help to notice LGD'S attitude. they seem to underestimate OG
I hate it when they always highlight n0tail and not ana 🙁
Jerax is like so high all the time :D
38:37 best moment
Simply amazing to revisit my favorite Grand Final in Dota history. I’ve been watching them since 2012.
Best True Sight ever!!!!
Which game is the best?
Nice game GGWP BOBO
"36:34 MATE
IT WAS THE MOST EPIC ONE"
Oppa oppa boys!
Rigged for sure fuck you valve
Comeback❤
"If LGD didnt ban centaur in game 4, Ceb probably wouldn't get the call of his life"
Go home og eh?😂
"-Nice!!!!!!
-My ears."
как же они читают игру
My tears cant hold up any longer when notail said 'i love this game so much'
"Haven't played since icefrogs original dota. Watching this, brings me back amazing memories of going to lans and playing ar. Awesome finals. Amazing filming and editing to the dota2 team. This has to be one of the best videos in esports to date. Grats OG"
The coach that turn to a player. The strategist do the thing in real fucking game. Ceb is the real brain of OG. Positive Thinker player gives hope to the team.
But where's fly?
"""Go Home OG"" yeah, they are going home. As millionaires. Hahahaha!"
probably Spectre was the best heroe pick in that International
56:12 cameraman did his job perfectly.
when somnus said kunkka i know its gonna be his game
delete team lgd
Number 1 trending until now
CEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBBB
"the OG have such a great teamwork spirit, they were joking and laughing even when  losing, Ceb is so good at the leader postition, he gathered  everyone and made them relax . and Ana didn't even saw his hero makes me laugh so hard =)))"
It seems like LGD crumbles when their strategy fails...
Ceb! such a great coach
"i like how people cheered for PSG at game 4 and yelled ""go home OG"" but after it they became an OG fan wanting a high five"
53:46 they fucking skipped the ember euls dodgin the echo slam that could've finished the game because ember has no buyback
Loved how they swear in their language for adrenaline boost
"Fucking true sight, man they made NoTail coming out from the cabin like a fucking movie, godly filming skills, good job!"
"56:10 we won ti, what the fuck ??
-topson 2018"
"56:34 LGD to Ana : ""Fucking traitor..."""
FY mind was broken!
722 dislike from brainless LOL player
tusk king??
Nature prophet winning hero?🤔 OMEGALUL
what notail said at 31:45 ?
Ana with that darth vader face expressions
"Win or lose we don't care,we play❤️"
Smoking is bad! This professionals should be role model not to smoke... But instead valve just ignore... too many young people watching True Sight... They would think its ok to smoke and feel that its great while playing Dota 2...
Love this ep. Of true sight
This is like watching C9 and Faze in the Boston Major.. Fucking amazing
36:00 PHANTOM LANCER = EPIC BOSS FIGHT
"46:33 ""Been ready for a long time"" - N0tail

This hits so hard"
"JerAx is something else isn't he?

Most of the time his face says it all, I mean we know they all must get nervous at some point, but that guy's expression can tell you that he's got amazing mental fortitude. I mean they all do, but JerAx is crazy"
Indonesia like.. inilah kenapa Dota gak pernah mati.. rasa kompetitif yang buat merinding
Topson has a very punchable looking face!
ive never played dota but man does this shit get me right in the feels epic stuff
love it when it turns to cinematic
ME la vi completa ahora soy pro.
"I feel bad for Topson, they really messed him up but I'm so glad their team is aware of his mental state."
LOL!
Go HOME OG?
Im so jealous i hope i can play and find  my real team soon
Ceb gives confidence and hopes to his teammate. Great player
39:43 lil pump watching ti8?  XD
Does the ti8 grandfinals only take a day only and then take a break outside for 15 min and then nxt game again?
"If anyone wants to know what Ceb is saying in French. He's saying ""we fuck your mothers"" and ""we fuck you in the ass""😂😂😂"
"The different of LGD n OG
LGD blaming to made their team stronger
OG supporting to made their team stronger"
""" we did it"".
They are very cool👍"
Ceb such a good leader with his talk....rallies the team
"dude im legit crying in ceb's call of his lifetime part man




on second thought... i cried in every part though"
"CS:GO > All other ""esport"" games. Dota boring shit."
this is so dramatic!
This is only like half the story of OG's victory
"GO HOME OG ? LMFAO, NICE LAST PICK SILENCER FOR YOUR OWN CROWD"
Best gaming video ever made. Unreal stuff.

"Man I swear this was so good. Congrats to OG for winning and very huge respect to team LGD, especially to one of my favorite player of all time FY hope I'll see him win a TI one day. All the best guys GG."

Ceb is definitely the MVP of the whole series. Always keeping team moral up. Destroyed game 4 with axe
"Ceb's Axe respond to Fy's Tusk King be like 

*""Why be a King when you can be a God?""*"
song 13:05?
"Ceb is even funnier when you understand what he says in French, this guy is my hero"
Can i get a list of music of this True Sight`s part?
LGD had all the strategy  OG had no specific strategy they just went with draft... but the main thing that won OG TI  was team chemistry and morale
55:37 when you're team loosing n the stage burn but it's fine
52:27 Fy gand phati??
En castellano por favor
Where's Axe?
ЭТО ПРОСТО НЕЧТО!
Please release the ost Valve <3  The feels during the Ceb's Speech before Game 5
"Jerax- Memes? 
Ana- Fuck off!
🤣"
"(53:28) Ceb: Allez, nique ta mère avec ton shaker xD"
Was it fucking Hans Zimmer at the end?  XD
How could you lose to these pieces of scum?
Spectre is badass <3

"Офигенный фильм, вызвал шквал эмоций, но возник один вопрос - что за штаны у ноутэйла?))))"
Topson is sooooooooooo bad . Can see he tilted and all his team need to comfort him while doing his job .
Fy is a magician jerax is Jysus
Ревел как сучка !
В России фильмы даже так не снимают
"34:08 ""Go home OG"" :) sure. they go home with $11,234,158 :)"
"Tompson: We won TI
                    wtf?"
"In terms of actual gameplay and how you approached the fights to me is really lackluster.  Like the fight at 50:17. It's a huge turnaround, but the way you presented this fight, you see nothing of what's actually happening. Why the focus on solely Ember?"
"og without ana = tier 3 team,  og with ana = tier 1 team"
so sad for psg
"такое ощущение, что не можешь поднять экран до конца"
yes navi won again 4th ti in a row
"Ame: thanks for 3million$$ - easiest match of convenience in my life. +++ 600.000$ for 2nd place(after taxes).
P.S. Only one person which you can't find in this video is Ame. They showed him for less then 5 secs during the 5 matches, and only a few seconds after, when he was sitting and smiling looking at his 4 sad almost crying teammates. Nice show, but tss they don't want to bother you with happy Ame's face."

no eg vs og true sight??
THIS THE FCKING BEST VIDEO!!!!! 😍
"Damn, that girl's facial expression at 54:45 really breaks my heart. She was probably cheering for PSG LGD so much but... . Sad but this is TI finals and there must only be one winner. I can't even imagine what LGD felt like, especially fy, he tried so hard to control himself in game 5. I think I'm going too emotional."
"59:46

""I strongly believe that if I woke up in the morning and I had to play the TI finals I would play the best dota of my life. That's all that would matter to me. To play my very best, nothing else would matter.""
-n0tail

Goosebumps!"
This is prolly the most emotional TI so far
54:45 the girl is more sad than whole LGD >_>
"and someone said that ""they spend a thousand of hours playing for nothing"" *look at those players*"
Sangat seru.
This was a wonderful watch
can we compare this with all of LOL championship finals please ?
2m view WOW
He broke a keyboard 55:21
Why Notail kept going to area which has NO SMOKING SIGN to smoke? @@ 17:39
"is it just me or LGD is far more tense compared to OG?i mean OG is just like ""yeah fuck em whatever yolo"" and LGD is like ""okay wtf are we gona do?"""
35:56 goosebumps
Kapan ya team Indonesia masuk TI.
@OG_FLUKE_TI 🤣
31:00 made me laugh too
The biggest mistake of human live 45:10
I can't even breath
MERINDING COK !!!!
you look
We badly need an episode of OG vs EG true sight
Damn those PSG make an Ivan Drago impression.
ceb's unorthodox pick in game 1 and 4 are the reason they won those games
я че английский должен учить
"""Teams that win game 1 always lose the finals""

Team Liquid: ""Am i a joke to you?"""
"Эти кинематографические отрезки - топ просто. Лучшее, что могли придумать валвы!"
Maybe a big factor why LGD lost is not bringing tp's  for team fights
"this was fucking surreal, just when you thought they knew what they’re doing when watching live match, the emotions were high AF. And I quote no-tail, “ DOTA is a sick game, it could get the best and worst of you”"
"35:56 
They are taking the high ground. 
They have a really big problem.
 PL level 25 guys."
Ceb is so positive hahahahaa
52:53 Jerax is almost in tears.
this masterpiece need over 10 mil views
36:00 yo that was epic
this shit is my favorite film so far. fucking love it!
chera no entendi el idioma
the last 20 minutes were so bad. not a single fucking gameplay scene just seeing the crowd with some casting. big dissapointment
Really funny how the best true sight episodes always have og in them... just cant stop crying idk why. But the best TI ever!
When i watched this live in twitch i thought ana was the mvp but when i see this truesight i changed my mind. Its ceb! Thats a true fucking captain nor slash coach u need. Not losing hope just positive! High risk high reward !! 💓💓
can anyone tell me what did ceb said in france? and also the meaning?
Best content good job create again next tourb
I will sub to anyone that subs to me
"Go ember, man!"
Smash That Like Button
ceb is very positive
z-z-z-z-z-zeus?
55:13 nOtail mixed emotions. He wanted to cry but holding it for the celebrations. Pure emotion.
"im crying, bois."
"The difference between those teams are the attitude not after winning, but after losing a game. LGD blames, and OG encourages."
I feels like joinnin to the game.
37:24 she want some lol
what is the song in 7:24 ??
"Music/songs? Is someone knows the song names that were used here (that kind of a ""thrilling"" songs like for thrailers)?"
WOAAH
smoking in the non smoking area lol
Never give up boisss 💪💪💪💪
36:35 damn that animation
Go Home LGD NOT OG
"37:29

Jerax: Ana, you wanna relo into the base?... Memes? 😁

Ana: Fuck off 😐

The look on their faces got me 😂"
[Go home OG] that's why OG win. 😂😂..... karma is real
did i hear pussy at minuted 6:51
This is the best True Sight Episode so far I must say that this series go on forever And BTW that call in game 4 was awesome in 38:40
"Ceb the best ingame leader i've ever seen,  if you watch sports this is example of a good captain
Really vocal, he serves his team mental support that every member need, no blames
and words that comeout from his mouth building his team morale
MVP hands down"
LGD knew they were going to loose.
54:45 Cry Bitch!
"29:45 ill destroy him
well ceb know how to increase team morale..."
Like this if jerax ES is better than fy
this just me or this documentary plot seems like karate kid movie
That explains the power of friendship and never losing hope
"what the heck,wheres fly?"
this is such great documentary
"I can't say something new, but i want to mark one of my fave moments. 58:52"
Who is the director of this movie? Hans Zimmer?
"Ana’s relaxation, Jerax’s positivity, Ceb and Notail’s leadership, and Topson’s calmness are the keys in their victory. LGD didn’t have those types of attitudes"
Я плачу парни
OMFG!!! THOSE CINEMATICS AND EDITION... IT WORTH EVERY SINGLE DAY OF WAITING TY SO MUCH

that would be really cool (but a hell lot of work and energy to make such a film)"
fuck the 686 people who disliked this video.
58:04 does anyone know whats the name of that chill music?!
14:45 Somnus Maybe: Kunkka
31:00 tell me what language is that ?
what did ceb say in 31:03? lol
Ito talaga ang mga totoong teammates! TI8 CHAMPION OG!!!!
"OG: 1 GAME AT A TIME
PSG.LGD: *BLAME PLAYERS"
N0tail and fy ngudud everywhere :v
"17:39 Dont smoke here- what do progamer ? smoke here, rly man"
Why chinese team doesnt have the air time? Why focuses on OG only if its the finals... it is written in the title finals not just OG
"I'm proud of OG an all, but I'm just putting it out there, Kuroky had the best TI victory of all time"
"i strongly believe dat if i woke up in d morning and i had to play d TI final ""I WOULD PLAY THE BEST DOTA OF MY LIFE""  and dats all dat would matter to me.
if i played my very best nothing else would matter."
whoever put their dedication into something they will get the prizes... this film for you notail
Знаете. Это просто охуенно
"This is awsome video, make me love dota2 so much!! Amazing comback for OG, comback is real!! Btw LGD did well also!"
Good job OG!
Oppa oppa boys 😂
55:02 He try to hold his smile??
This is the proof that heart is better than mind. LGD drafted their planned heroes while OG drafted any heroes that they feel the most and follow their heart. They really deserves it!
notail deserved his aegis. i always wanted him to win it. good job :)
"I think Ceb has a really good role here - Backing up notail to as new captain, but acting like one himself through the games. LGD has the technical superior players, tries to win early-game and linearly end the game. OG has better team communication, motivational talks, and is able to fix mistakes through teamplay more thank skillset on each hero. I really favor OG to win since I value the teamplay vs pure skill like LGD."
Drink vodka play dotka!

"jerax :  ana, can u tell if they rupture u  bcoz i think u get fucked and i have to relo u out, right?
jerax: ana? 

ana: sorry?
........
jerax: just tell me... blah blah blah thats the only thing i care about his game

ana: I dont even know what the fuck is going on, I cant even see my hero"" 

jerax: *laughs"
Fucking somnus
no smoking
Surely nervous
"28:14 Fucking  hell,they dare to pick Axe in front of the Tusk King- FY"
"Guys I can't find the accurate translation on what notail shouted at 31:01, the same at 31:40 . I don't know if that is Danish or what. Thanks!"

"I think addition to an aegis they should also make the items of the heroes that the champions and runner-ups played to honor them xD like ember's divines/hat, es's totem,.. Etc.. and they are delivered later or kinda it would be cool xD"

We yelled ""OG, OG"" at the end."
"psg lost focus late game, and they seems cant follow og outside of the box way of thinking"
"спасибо вам ребята и кто сделал это документирущее видео , просто слёзы на глазах от этого триумфа ребят и командной игры! Спасибо"
38:30 the best part
"The person who said “On last ride, Johan.” was Ana, right?

I hope that’s not really the last."
Imagine if if this get an anime show every hero they pick it has a dramatic moment
Something worth it to watch for a whole hour straight

55:36 sadness from the Tusk King
I would go to the cinema to whatch this movie)
i really like seeing chinese teams lose but man. i felt bad for them. i really like how they showed the other side of this. not just focusing on the winning team.
Mental warfare?? OG win.
For 1 hour vid. I didnt see ame talk hahahh
GGWP OG
"51:09 that moment when you ignored xNova's opinion just because he doesn't talk much, kinda silent type of guy. it cost them a freaking TI8"
31:41 pota hahahaha
"That CEEBBB moment and words from OD bring me to tears everytime.
""He got the call of his lifetime"" is like you finally achieve your goal in life through the fire and flames.
It motivates me to keep moving forward. We all will get ""our call of our life time"" too in the future, in whatever we pursue. cheers guys."
I feel sorry for FY. He deserves to win.
this video proves that there really is more to dota than just a game
GG!!!
Still cannot apprehend what the fuck those guys did. 7ckngMad you my dude are absolutely awesome. You deserved it more than anyone.

38:48 I'm waiting the need chat wheel for ti9
Ceb is still like this when he is a coach for OG and guess what they are winning majors. But he need to step as a player for them to grab TI. Amzaing person.
Best true sight doco so far
37:30 memes?
55:43 the other guy is just like: wtf is this tension going on here
Im so emotional and im cry

Look at their faces before they enter for game 5)"
FyGod
Ana's face is always the same you never know if hes happy or not...i guess he will be  good in poker too
OG GO Home OG GO HOme ! As a WINNER ? For Sure !
Видно что OG команда. Вне кабины они всегда вместе поддерживают друг друга. Что не скажешь о PSG.
"""They have a really big problem, guys... PL level 25"" that shit gave me goosebumps."
One last ride Johan. One last ride
WHAT IF PSG.LGD DIDN'T BAN CENTAUR ON GAME 4? WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPEN? Just wondering....
Feels bad for Fy. He did a great job but his teammates got carried away.
Себ настоящий батя.Он нереально поддерживал своих парней.Просто вытащил всю команду!
"I believed in their victory.It was the best ending ever. Ceb the best.Precisely but ask the spirit of the entire team.
The film is very emotional.Thanks"

"Respect OG 👌 Ceb is the fcking mvp man 🏆 The best scene for me is when notail is laughing at the end, maybe can't still believe they won ti. Props to LGD for a great series.."
Dead game
11:32 Spy ZAI
the face on notail when he holds the aegis... men im crying 😢😢😢
Ana reaction so priceless! Zero fuck given..
Nothing better than the asian teams loosing
"52:56 Notice how fy was about to comment, but he took it back and realised it's important to look at the bright side of things to get the most out of the situation."
Ceb il me fume xDD
Newbee had much better attitude than LGD
"maybe it's just my feeling, but true sight always make chinese team look like antagonist, haha.. i'm curious how will it be when chinese team win the next tournament

and that 5th game, the definite example of playing to win vs playing to not lose"
"И ведь он правда - одурел от эмоций, это то что нельзя подделать 58:55"
Где теперь мне найти эту музыку?
42:00 he's like a dad to them and I get so motivated all the time
Who thought dota is dying hmm?look at that #1trendingforgaming I think dota is evolving

"this was the best TI and e sports story of all time, truly magical"
56:09 we won ti what the fck😂😂😂
"30:31 if the fy not taunt the axe , he might be save bloodseeker by snowball from the culling blade from axe, sometimes ridicule doesn't make excuse,A wrong step will make you fall into the abyss"
They have a big problem guys *PL 25 goosebumps up my asscrack
Feels bad for fy man
"As life catches up on me and my Dota mates, we stopped playing Dota and I've uninstalled it. At the same time, I decided TI8 was gonna be the last TI I follow, and goddamn it was the best TI to conclude my Dota chapter. The final which I want both team to win, full 5 games, OG EG drama, redemption for Notail and especially Ana, the one timer tourney player winning TI, breaking the even year TI curse, best TI after party talk/interview. Damn glad I pulled a no-sleep over this final day. It was an amazing 10 years and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
This is the curtain call...

see you guys in Sing's Twitch maybe

P.S. don't fight over who the MVP was, it's definitely Ceb's paper. See how LGD's players make so much fuss about it with their eyes trembling. LOL

Jokes aside, damn OG deserves to win. All Notail talk about Dota being a mental game; to have the mentality keep playing to win even when they are losing, both when taking game 4 and 5, is above average human. One shred of ""We lost this"" thought would have lost them everything. Many would crumble and break down in that situation and I won't blame them for it, yet OG prevailed and won. THIS, we all can learn and apply in our life. Salute to them"
"Players, community and valve keeping the game alive!"
"That moment when they try to convince Ceb ""Ceb It's real"" gets me into tears.. What a phenomenal run at TI."
All that matters to me is bulba highfive in 59:45
"19:39   LGD: *picks weaver*
Notail: what the fuck? 
Ceb: yeeea.. chen pl?
OG: Yeeaahh.. Yeah? YEEAAAHH!"
"ohh, these are emotions"
I thought Ana & Topson are the MVP's of the finals but it was Seb and Notail carry the team mentally and hold them together.
What's that song @ 37:00 ?
Ame so quiet KREYGASM
"""holy crap Ceb is holding a bunch of papers"" hahaha"
Karate Kid 2
nice
Now i can die in peace
38:50 are you kidding me ? did you really not show the play so you can show that shity clip? People want to see the game wth is this
dude do anyone realize they made og look like the good guys and psg lgd is like the antagonists of the video.
"Og is just enjoying,
Lgd is serious"
Ceb is just so underrated. Someone need to make him a trend and be appreciated for being in the scene like other superstars. He is an example of perfect leadership. He never fails to motivate his teammates and up their fighting spirit even at the most down moments.
Кому слабо переснять на русскую озвучку?😎
where is oppa oppa boys
"ну честно можно сказать, после победы на инте сейчас ты добился всего в этой жизни"
nice
"Fy- they dare pick axe in front of tusk king?
Ceb- omae wa mou
Fy- what? 🤨
Ceb- shindeiru
Fy- *NANI*

OG wins TI8"
Ez LGD
"sumiya???? in the lgd????
they look same"
then why ana get out after ti8 :( i really like how ana and topson playing
"The real story on the finals is, LGD was so full of their illusions. The one that defeated them is themselves. Saying picking Axe is bull$hit, well they were right. They lost on AXE on draft that they should win. Game was not decided no mater what is the % on win probability. What matter most is your heart, passion, and willing to put in all. 

LGD won if they were not looking on data. They have the number, they have a great coach, but one they don't have is the heart of a TEAM. IMHO they were all bull$hit trashtalking the team when there are not even close on winning the game...


THEY GOT SERVED."
35:41 kennyS?
we are the champion on the year my team is rampager
52:14 best moment
"please convince notail to stop smoking, i dont want a legend dying at a young age"
"""We don't even know what they're picking""

Guess liquid or Kuroky is still putting up a better mind games on drafting phase"
come back is real
"I love Ceb handles the team, so positive in any situation even on loosing game. This kind of player needs to be on every team to help motivate and regain focus"
PL looks like a big boss in a video game  36:00
Awesome OG
lol listening to how psg.lgd players talk bad and then see their faces after losing. what a sight
trust of ceb for his team is tremendous. he trust topson to pick invo again even when he got owned in their last game. now that's what i called a leader✌️
Hit like kung naniniwala kayong may mapapanood tayong PILIPINO dito 🇵🇭
55:41 watching them you can feel the pain and defeat still it was a hard faught battle. OG’s championship is so much satisfying than Kevin durant’s 2 championships
whats with all the cigarette smoking man. such a bad example for all the fans out there.
is it me or True sight and Valve have no clue what ANA did at game 4 to tip the series over? his clutch buyback was not mentioned. this gave Ana true confidence heading into game 5. look carefully at Og Ana game 4. he knew that it was up to him to lead Og to the promise land. look carefully at his facial expressions.
notails face and reaction at 55:14 it was epic
"Не прошло и полгода. А нет, прошло..."
628 LGD fans dislike this video :P
respect
Ceb is the real MVP 😌👌
And I love every reaction of Jerax hahaha
"Ceb the true MVP and good leader, notail the hardworker, jerax the best support, ana the genious carry, and topson the mysterious person ;)"
ana like i dont care
where is ame
that cao ni maa is golden
I feel bad for FY
Ceb's Axe is the best in this series <3 So loving it.
"Oh, my lord!"
this is the best documentary in dota 2
"Best series of the best game ever! So fucking emotional. Sadly i have to quit after my second child was born. Really cant find the time to play with my busy job and a family to take care.
But watching this game makes me feel like 20 again, so carefree so fun."
55:13 that feeling.
i got tears watching this. anyone else?
"9:23 ""oppa, oppa, boys!"""
"""Give this boy invoker"" ceb u god"
We should thank Fly for this.
"This documentary is so good. The chills, man.

And also, the magnificent display of Ceb's Oedipus complex. XD"
"Arrogance made you lose LGD wheres your confidence now...
Just sayin"
WE NEED TI6 TRUE SIGHT TOO
"Ceb is so GG. A true sight of Motivator!
I always like to see Ana's expression, he is so focus and not get distracted, not even with his team mate. :D"
Это божественно.
Goosebump!
"27:16 
- You said you really like Invoker?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Give the boy Invoker!!!"
"Stop making it like a movie
We want to watch as a player perspective, not a hero perspective
It may be good if there is only one or two crucial scene made into movie style.
For example 38:41, i just want to enjoy the epicness of that scene, but u just ruin it perfectly
Give us the GAMEPLAY!!"
28:14 40 min. later
Best true sight i've ever seen in my life
i criey like small noob kid :)
Thank you for not shooting Ame. I'm really mad for that tb dickhead tp to shrine bottom and dead for nothing
fuck can't say anything.. before i watched this video jerax is mvp after watching this video ceb is the true sight mvp.. well played editing team
the editing is just beautiful
"the loser of ti7 is much better, this ti8 lgd is so calm not so dramatic and moving"
"i wonder what somnus eat at 18:20 , kind of vitamin or caffeine?"
17:41 there is no smoking sign but still smokes infront of it HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
anyone waitin for that echo dodge by ana...
inuuna kasi yabang e. hahahahaha TEAM SPIRIT IS THE KEY masyadong naging confident e yan bagsak tuloy.

31:00 That one toxic friend who talk funny everytime he talk trash and you were sitting there and cracking  up 31:04
"go home china, no one waiting for you"
Self proclaimed tusk king	< literal axe king
"CELEB THE MVP, GET TEAMS MORAL BY HIS WORDS"
Too cocky lgd lmao.
I dont know why Valve ignores 2 key moments when Ana sold items to enough gold for buy back and Ana euls to avoid Echo Slam.
Give the crown to Ceb dude. We all know they played their best. But make sense Ceb one of the motivation in this team. He never get angry or mad but always positive 💕
more like this dota please..make the world crazy about dota
Этот китаец так смачно курит
is Karma a thing?
I am Chinese.and Im the lgd fans too.but respect for og. maybe too cocky in team and no listen to xnova.he say dont fight ros cuz they have zeus.anyway I love dota and I hope TI9 we can see the best new team  new face new play.PSG LGD is Worst enemy.like last boss in game. and OG like a hero story kill the dragon. GGWP
14:46 Somnus fusion with attacker
"11:50 n0tail is smokin, meanwhile ceb holding a fcking banana"
I DONT CARE WHAT Y`ALL GONNA SAY BUT I NEED OG VS EG TRUESIGHT
Road to 2 million!
52:52 Jerax almost cried.
FY was the best individual player whole tournament long. Sad for him.
37:31 memes?
53:52 the guy with the og mask looks like fckin yeezy busta lol
"i like that ""o"" mouths"
we want subtitles in Spanish!
ceb and n0tail speaking french followed by jerax laughing is the best lol 30:57
52:19
"LGD 2-1 (during breaktime) 25:20

remember to take off your jacket when you win

dont jinx it...

(fucked.....)"
best editing and sound. love it!
"Go Home OG? F*ck it, No more fcking china no.1!!!"
Meanwhile at EG. . .
GREATEST SOUNDTRACKS. drop here tracklist BlessRNG
I NEED THE SOUNDTRACK SO BAD MAN!!!!
Jerax at 37:28 manage to ask about doing memes in the finals 😂
"GO HOME LGD
GO HOME
GO HOME LGD
GO HOME"
"fy:where's axe?
ceb:*answers the call*"
"""Get fucking fucked"" 
___*ceb"
"kay, good stuff but I need to find the background music between 58:15 - 58:49"
Does anyone know the piano playing in the background of 41:44 ?
30:40 lakad matatag❤️
"Game 5 roshan fight. 
Ceb: ""win or loss we dont care, we play"". Ceb prove that every game dont play just to win, instead play to enjoy and you can win."
The aegis on the clickbait look like a gem of true sight
"""overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer"""
"You all gotta admit that Ceb's call change everything, their morale, spirit etc. He carried so hard. And ana be like ""yeah yeah guys we win TI, but is ember still good?"""
Where is Mr. Lakad Matatang ??? the core part of team OG?
"FY: Fucking hell, they dare to pick Axe in front of the Tusk king?

(After 15 or 20 mins)

FY: Where's  Axe?

FUCK YOU FY!"
14:43 Kunkka!!!
"Damn, this TI was for me the most intense in my life. the reaction of Russian commentators when Vilat screamed about the OG championship, I woke up (I fell asleep at the end of the game) and was shocked by the fact that the OG came out of the booth and took Aegis"
Sombong bener lgd fak wkek
Hope LGD gonna win next one.
35:57 goosebumps
51:11 XNova said they should not go for rosh because zeus is alive but Lgd doesn't care about his opinion. They end up losing the rosh and because of that they loss the game 5.
Damnnn this is so gooooooood!
40:17 Gotta love that Jerax smile!
"I don't play dota anymore cuz of responsibilities, and watching this makes me remember the times when my friends and I play 5v5 lobby. Ah those fun days"
It was EPIC
Слов нет. Одни имотцыи.
"I REMEMBER "" FREE TO PLAY """
Tusk king my sh*t xD
Intense than the fucking bird box!!!
Cyna pro runer up haha
Lakad matataa.........the best
at 6:00 Ceb says they already won everything there. I guess winning againts EG is the true win for them? and TI is an extra?
Jerax likes memes
"LGD: ""they play like idiots"" = banhammer 3-2!"
Best TI ever
4:40 - 4:54 just gives me instant goosebumps. So fuckin sick.
Sometimes being humble is the key to victory.
"If the caption really translate what LGD said, it would be so much fun"
POSITIVITY MADE THEM TI CHAMPS!! GO OG!!!!
GO HOME CHINA! GO HOME CHINA!... a whip in the ass. kaboom.
I love jerax expression after 30:53 lel
609 CHINESE DISLIKED THE VIDEO LMAO
It's all good but don't forget to nerf CM.
30:55
no.1 trending now wtf
What if 2 Chinese team fight in the ti finals? it's was just like a watching anime subtitles?? lol
there is so many 'fuck' i hear
It was the shortest hour in my life)
"This was truly amazing, god i loved this."
CEBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

52:50 jerax 😢
Ругательства на французком окуенны))))))) 31:00
55:30 CEB IS REAL CEB IS REAL 💪
THE BEST MOVIE I SAW IN MY LIFE !!!!!!! I CANT BELIVE I WANNA DIE IM COMPLETLY FULL AFTER I SAW THAT !!!!
Ceeeebbb!!!
"remember the name n0tail
#BigDaddyn0tail"
Я плакал как сучка))
"Ceb is a truly amazing mate...
Removing all the negativity on the team..."
"10:04 Check your left, Notail. Messi? What you are doing here?"
I love how OG play
that cebbbbb gets me hyped every fking time
we got to appreciate ceb's influence on the game ...he still has the coach attitude and thats one the best reasons why og won
"Only Legends can get  their name embedded into the Agies and finally Notail did it OG did it, yes it's so awesome feeling finally they did it .#DREAMOG ❤"
"The more u trashtalk, the more u gonna get smacked."
"Guys, understand that this video was cut totally in favor of team OG, it made LGD like a team without communication, which is not true and fair, LGD beat the incredible VP and Liquid in straight game before fight OG, it takes a lot to have done that. And there are many splendid, game changing group fights that should be highlighted in this video, which were not included out of no reason. In fact, in Game 5, it is totally a winning game for LGD if they been less cocky, instead of BKB, Kunka purchased the pricy Tarrasque which make him vulnerable and useless in the group fights, and the key Roshan fight after a battle win, Chalice TP to the down lane, trying to slay prophet on himself  instead of slaying Roshan together, made it lack of damage to slay the Roshan in time, gave OG the opportunity to win the fight and Aegis, which become a game changer afterwards. So, this video should be called ""A Glimpse (of TI8 Final) "" instead of ""True Sight"", because it is biased and poorly scripted. Finally, we both agree this is the most splendid TI final of all time, two TI deserving team brought us a feast of eyes. PS. I know the boys of LGD will surely come back in TI9, because they've paid their price and learned a valuable lesson, but OG will probably not."
"2016: 4-3 Cleveland - GSW 
2018: 3-2 OG - PSG.LGD"
no ame throw?
Ceb is the real MVP !!!!
*Anything can work*
30:58 anyone know what Ceb said?
"34:09  ""go home OG""

hell no! comeback is real man"
48:38 ~ 38:41
All dumbasses lol
"Just for starters here is some info about what they're talking about (the positions):
*this is just for beginners, those who really have no idea. don't hate me for the comment

Position 1: is the hardest carry, the priority position. one who gets most of the farm and avoids early to mid-game teamfights unless completely necessary and does not hurt farm time.
(heroes: anti-mage, TB, Void)

Postion 2: typically the midlaner. the role of this position is to destroy the enemy position 2, while also being able to roam and help get kills for the carry. all the while avoids getting killed by 3 or 2 man-ganks at mid (heroes: Shadow Fiend, QoP, Storm)

Position 3: the suicide/sacrificial lane, usually solos the lane against the enemy safelane (tho suicide lanes now are also played dually). main job is just to not get killed and holding his tier 1 tower for as long as possible. most of the time gets no farm at all too due to pulling and lane management of enemy safelane. heroes in this lane are those with hard sustain and escapes
(heroes: Treant, Axe, Necrophos, Mirana)

Position 4: the roaming support/jungler. it is usually the player with the best macro skill and mindset in the game. *most teams have their captains as position 4. primary role is to help set up kills by roaming, smoke ganking and causing destruction on other lanes while also successfully warding/dewarding key areas
(heroes: Enigma, Earthshaker, Tusk)

Position 5: the babysitter support. the one whose just only job is to always help the carry when being hunted or ganked. main job is to not let the hard carry die.
(heroes: crystal maiden, wisp, shadow shaman)"
nice O.G win this game <3
"""CCCCEEEEEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBBB!!!!!!!! HE GETS THE CALL!!!! OF HIS LIFE TIME !""

THAT WAS BEAUTIFULLLLLL"
"@dota2
use hans zimmer for TI9 true sight.. >.<"
38:39 meme herw mates :))
РАШН КОМЕНТАРИЙ!!
Amazing. Just like the Kiev Major. The same OG who came back from 3-18 deficit.
Why do they always make the Chinese team looks like the villain in this True Sight series? FeelsBadMan.
"There's a huge difference between thr two teams during the last game tho, in terms of attitude and positivity."
Why Ame- is not in the vid for even a sec?
Why am i nervous im not even playing.......??😧😧
Axe is back
"1 hour video, AME spoke just ONCE deym!"
606 dislike from fan of lose ti8
"The Goosebumps dude .. damn, i wish i can feel it too how to be the Winnner of TI"
30:58 Can someone's write in french exactly what he said that part ?
"Crit bumped and notail shoulder massage 
5:28 and https://youtu.be/ma-TFZKx6LQ?t=463"
Now we know ceb is the mvp
at 5:30 i think the shoulder rub actually a diss for fly....because fly used to do that
да че этим китайцам победа бл их миллиард и столько бабла у них эт пздц
WOW CEB 1MILLION COMMENDED!!! 👍👍👍
12.41 lol
Thx valve for creating this <3
Im so happy for notail. Well deserved.
31:44 puuuuuutaaaa -n0tail
udud terooooos
35:16 the start of the end.
55:39 i feel the silence... it feels like they want to cry.
why i need the true sight clip of OG vs EG too?
what a game
"finally for once in real life, the GOOD GUYS won."
@25:25 LGD got jinxed lol
IM NOT CRYING. U'RE CRYING
Dont think about the win or lose just  enjoy the game😂😂😘😘
"Strong team communication and bonding is the key, Team liquid showed it in Ti7 and OG adapted it in Ti8. Its so nice to see OG win, positivity, as mr. Babyrage says PMA."
"38:35
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeb!"
Ceb ganteng amat y
How long n0tail wait for this TI winner ? 5 years ? more or less ?
fucking hate the guy with glasses and pimples around his mouth. over confident and underestimate OG. I am not wondering why they lost.
Best than Yt rewind 2018
It's so sad that Jerax/Topson  Comeback play didn't include in this documentary. That is was one of the best comebacks i've ever seen in DOTA.
YAS
"""Go home OG"" Yap OG has returned home with Aegis of The Champions."
OG are God’s from comeback
Wow no. 1 on trending. GG
"Crowd chanted ""GO HOME OG"" so they did...and they took the aegis with them too."
"Ура, дота в трендах!!"
The all we've been waiting for
I LIKE DOTA2 VERY MUCH. I LIKE THIS MOVIE TOO
so FUCKING Great Man!! so FUCKING Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38:48 fuckin' hype pogchamp
"""go home og"" then they went home as champions"
Animations on point! The Ceb Axe highlights still replays in my mind..
"you pick axe agaisnt tusk king ? 
yeah they win actually"
CR1T SUCKS!!!
So inspiring i wanna play again to my first love dota 😍
This is why i’ll never be a fan of any chinese team.so fucking arrogant
"Great players but... LGD's conversation with each other is just so distasteful.  I understand Mandarin so i know that this documentary really toned down the foul language by the Chinese team. Didn't expect this level of etiquette on a world-class competition. Well, it is also completely possible that this film is biased to show the nicer side of winning team."
Even if I knew OG won watching this gets my blood pumping. Good editing!
"Why notail keep smoking at no smoking zone?
Because he doesn't give a fuck"
"Крупные планы с топсоном ваще пушка, у него такие сочные задротские прыщи"
"45:34 “Go fucking Ember, I trust your fucking Ember”😂"
That's how DOTA 2 works!
Как же я обожаю SFM вставки!!!
14:43
"Жалко ребят из LGD они самый сплоченный и скиловый состав в про доте и слезы на их глазах пздц они сильно расстроились, занять второе место очень обидно"
Epic video. Also this was the best TI imo.
"Wtf, i’ve always known that the chinese are quite full of themselves and arrogant, but i definitely did not expect them to be THAT into themselves."
Pleas help me find her  29:48  it is important 4me Pls
ceb positive energy is a good way to win
17:42 smoking at the non smoky zone nOtail😂😂
can anyone please tell me what was said by nOtail in 31:01?
кто из 2021 ?
True Sight of OG vs EG. N0tail & Fly
"25:19 "" if we win next game, remember to take off ur jacket. Fvck shit dont jinx us."" Yeah right u cocky bastard. Who ever said that deserves to be punched in the face."
wtf they actually reading each other mind
When your mom see's you watching porn 2:44 xD
I’m so happy for n0tail!!!!!
You also have sea player..give us the translate too...

This True Sight is just AWESOME! Made me play doto again.
"Wow, so intense! 😬"
"How dare they pick Axe against King of Tusk ? IT IS 7CKNGMAD YOU FOOL.

"46:05 ""No matter what it is, we're gonna destroy them with it!"" -Ceb

I want those sweat pants
you can see the lack of experience the LGD have compare to OG
@17:38 XD
31:44 N0tail : PUTANGGGGGG~!
"34:15 GO HOME OG ? If its'me, i'm very nervous"
"38:40 - 38:54 makes me have a goosebumps, that cinematic scene"
Плакала от радости за OG в 2018 и сейчас от радости за них плачу уже в 2019
"respect  OG , they doing great"
memes?
Ohh how I missed playing DOTA 2 :(
"Слабенкий трусайт, могли бы полуфиналы немного хоть зацепить или концовку сделать нормальной. Жиробас опять обленился короче"
Bring tears to my eyes
Ana is x53 better than Ame
"impresionante EG es mi equipo histórico, pero OG demostró ser el digno campeón de la edición actual"
Valve put credits on your shit people worked hard on this
"Who was singing ""Thats the way uhuh uhuh I like it"" xD that was awesome"
"I swear, Ceb is the most chill, carefree, YOLO, dgaf dude I've ever seen, and I think that's what builds the trust in their team"
"How dare he pick axe against the tusk god!...... CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBB Call of his lifetime!!!!! love OG, super happy they won ti <3"
"Game 4 was 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Og rise lgd fall..."
"I like how Somnus says ""Kunkka"" lmao"
Was hoping that the fly and notail drama was here
Commend the camera men and the editing is amazing
"Other crowd says. ""Go Home OG"". Now look at their face at 54:32! Now OG go home with the aegis hahahaha"
"50:48 
jerax : ana ur so fucking cute man. hahahaha"
"Beautiful, so much emotion. God I love dota."
Damn goosebumps! I've watched this from 0.00 till the end! Thanks Dota 2 team & valve for bringing this history to us!
"смотрел и переживал так, как будто я сам там играл в финале. классный фильм получился"
I felt like this ti has the most real emotions
Brilliant series!!! Hope to see more in coming future!!
"I'm crying watching this film. Fuck. This is so great! Valve production team, you did great!"
49:49 he almost cried. yohann
Ana win this team 😊
"12:40 ""TEAM THAT WIN GAME 1 ALWAYS LOSE THE FINALS"" 
Sad lgd 😂"
Mute your mouth fy u lost the game haha
Where is Fly ??
31:44 *was notail trying to say putangina?* HAHAHAHA
Cyka blyat GG
"daaamn, one of the best films"
55:14 THAT REACTION GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS
Comeback Is Real
"I've  watched it 3 times lol 
I love the way OG play the game their down by 2 but they still joking and smiling"
"39:48 me too, me too"
2:44 when ur mom suddenly enter ur room while u watching porn
"14:45 what do you want pick against their 2 cores??

KUNKKA!!"
The mentality of 7ckingmad  is just so 👌 👌. damn he just puts everyone together.
"Ok, let's do og vs eg true sight now 😂"
22:05 I actually love the animation coming up here. BKAAAA
Why cut 12m cyclone dodge
"""Remember bois its not over til its over""  poor boo*id hahahhaa"
By far one of the best insights in the Dota/esports series ever.
CEB NUMBER1!!!!!1!!1!
Who thought the thumbnail was Pewdiepie and jack
"I am so grateful OG won, otherwise this beautiful story would not have existed!"
Pleeassee help me to promote my channel 😭
somnus face is all day mood
Og deserved that win 😍😍
damn CEB IS A MF GOAT!!
Nganga ang mga loko hahahahaha.
"Best True Sight so far.

Edit: That's the lesson for the Chinese power house. Sometimes we don't try to win, how life treat us. It's not all about winning, sometimes you just need to get along and enjoy what's there got you. OG are the Kings this time."
Oh god i'm crying
35:56 What a BadAss PL
"Falto ver la jugada de Ana vendiendo sus items, sin eso perdia OG"
The merlinis was so sad
This film had me feeling at every point. I watched the international game by game and in comparison it was truly remarkable the amount of detail that went into the special effects by the artists that did the battle clips of the actual tournament fights. In all 5/5 new sub
This is better than MCU
"CEB!! Such player, such motivator.."
"5:30 ""Which shoulder is it, man."" #Cr1tshoulderbump #TIwinningmassage."
x2018 times better than Youtube Rewind 2018
The fuck n0tail smoking on no smoking sign. So brave
am i the only one that getting a goosebump watching this?
"Chinese are true champion





of acting pro, thrastalking and being trashed. Get rekt dog. Want to go in booth also looking for da-ge (brother). Such a baby, worst than RTZ"
the team wins game 1 loses the finals....Lmao What about liquid vs newbee?
GOOSEBUMPS!
DAMN. FUCKING REAL TRUE SIGHT AT THE END!
this is the most interesting documentary behind the scenes video ive ever seen. Really gives true sight!
Better and longer than TI7 true sight
"Waiting for this, finally!"
"i like Ana's style. Not too much talking, silent and deadly."
"One more thing I found kinda funny was that OG knew they had LGD at game 5, game is almost done, racks destroyed and shit, yet they were still playing like the game just had the first teamfight xD they were so serious and they weren’t done kicking their asses hahaha"
i thought TI8 story will focus about friends betryl of fly and notial xD
The only difference between the two teams I felt was OG was playing for fun where as PSG.LGD was playing for winning which pressured them too much.
"59:32 i think n0tail is thinking about Fly at this moment, imagining the possibility if they could've lift the aegis together"
"Niceeeee onee,,, n wtf,, why im cryin for lgd😢😢"
JERAX FOREVER
They had really good animations
38:39 Where axe ? xD
"brilliant, amazing... intense. A dream for many ... absolutely beautiful!"
I starting cry when Axe -ceb helping PL -ana..:'( thats the real hero
I need someone like Ceb man.
Without 7ckingmad OG might lose hahahahhahah he’s the one keep on motivating them

"Fy tusk king yes, but ceb is axe god"
31:16 here comes the rap XD
"best true sight video ever. Editing and the animations were on point.  NoTail and Ceb being positive throughout the whole series sealed the deal. Congrats to OG! They came a long way, especially NoTail. PSG LGD definitely looking to get their revenge this year. Good luck to both."
14:45 i like how somnus say Kunkka
"I love how true sight shows the human behind the players
I really did feel emotions; excitement, sadness, nervousness and WINNING!
Looking forward for the next TI and true sight"

Guys... what hero is on the screen at 5:42 ? I'm pretty sure there's no set for Huskar that looks like that. Is that a Mars cameo or am I seeing things?
KUNTAAAAA
The footage is made like it's an actual film. Love it!!!!
i watched this 3 times already its fkin epic !
"Even when they are winning, lgd is still too salty"

"every day a thousand people plays dota
every day those players sacrifice their hours for this game 
every day peole who didnt play the game asked what a stupid way to waste a person's time and asking was is worth it ? 

but each day the people who didnt play dont  know and felt how much the game have given the players joy. 
there are stories of how many people losses their job their money their colledge time for this game. i dont why the reason people manage sacrifice it. but im one of those people who did it. 

and was it worth it ? 

I said YES... 

beacouse dota isnt just a game is THE game"
"Боже, я даже слезу пустил.."
"59:42 I still remember the quote from notail back at Manila Major 2016. Watching him saying it, forward ~2 years, he is there doing it! How fucking prophetic was that! 
Fucking best closure!"
"sombong si lu anjeng, kalah kan"
I don't know much about Dota but this was amazing to watch.
17:30 Level 35 boss n0tail lights up a cigarette next to No Smoking Sign. Feels badass man.
Best ti ever
Fly what you have done.
"Хмм, странно снято. Почему 3ю игру показали так, что как будто ОГ проигрывал её с самого начала. А то что они первые мин 30 тащили, и тупо проиграли из-за того что дали Алхиму нафармить не показали.. Сделали видос так, выставив ОГ командой, у которой было 0 шансов, но они вытащили благодаря Себу с его речами..
Ни в коем случае не хочу занижать его вклад, он очень помог. Но показывают что они тооолько на + морали выйграли. А ошибки ЛГД не показывают, говеного батрайдера не показывают. И наоборот, как тащил Топсон в 3й игре на морфе не показывают..
Гайдай какой-то.А ин-т был топ)"
"jerax's face at 52:52 is like ""these fuckin idiots.i love playing with them!"" lmao"

CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB
Ahh finally ...
"All TRUE SIGHT wait reaction Ame, becouse he solo loose 3 game in TI final, but not seen that. Nice morf wthis difusal! GG Ame."
FUCKING EPIC. THE GOOSEBUMPS MAN WTF
To be honest this made me like Ceb a lot. Didn’t really follow him well but I feel he kept the team together and was a heavy support for N0tail as well
What a great game this is. Truly.
"The team spirit on OG is incredible. Losing 15-4 in kills and they still joke around and have a laugh. And Seb... what an amazing team player, constantly motivating his teammates.

Also i think they should have prize giving ceremony with like 30 awards for individual player all worth $1000. Awards such as best solo kill feed, or most average wards placed by a single player. And then they should make it a black tie event, similar to the Oscars. For smaller and for Dota"
"52:10Guys Win or Lose, We dont care, We play. Thats a true spirit of OG."
it's divine.
"Заставили меня плакац опять :'c Хоспади, как это шикарно"
Its kinda funny how ceb is holding a banana while notail is smoking lol
"The difference between confidence and arrogance explained... Great movie, thanks"
and then you still lose against turtling team LOL
Ceb is an incredible athlete.
Much respect to ceb for trusting his team
It's amazing and so emotion movie
Its me or the cabin guys are twins ?
"theres so much going wrong with the mentality and behaviour of the chinese team. the breaks are so fucking important to reflect and motivate each other as a team, but instead they split, 2-3 go out for fresh air/smoking and 2-3 are staying inside. theres no positivity after a lose, not enough communication and faces just go down in frustration. also winners focus on winning, losers focus on winners: lgd trying to figure out all the movements and gestures in the chamber of OG, like ""look at ceb where is he pointing his finger?"" who cares dude, focus on winning!
OG played and won as a team. lgd would've won but 1. they got cocky 2. they drafted bad and 3. they are very good individual players, probably better than OG's, but they are not as good as a team as OG is. fuck man, Ceb and notail in your team and youre good to win a TI with that kind of motivation on your back."
"28:06 Seb Axe - ''you're gonna see some shit man"""".
Well he wasn't wrong about that."
Oh Ceb you are my hero man....
communist country always gets too carried away when they lead the series
GO HOME OG? YES PLEASE. WITH THE AEGIS AND TI CHAMPION TITLE. FUCK U ALL LGD FANS
"FY, what a guy!"
"Just like at Kiev Major, such a great mood and attitude within the team. They constantly cheer each other and motivate to perform their best. Great performance by everyone for sure."

"Mi team de cerranos algun dia :,v"
"The character that bring OG team spirit up was Ceb, wise word, no pressure, play, have fun - ""You really like invoker? Then take invoker"", now topson got his name for his invoker play even Sumiya (8k games with invoker) know and like him"
"I don't feel bad one bit for LGD , I also hate the part where the fans was chanting Og to go back home lmao. That's karma , looks like LGD will
be the one going back. Aww man Look at the fans and LGD faces. The sad emotion faces and they deserve it. I don't care if im getting hate because I support

China #2
So many fucks no wonder theres no ads.
that big deep breath of notail in that last game tho. the feels man
I don't want to hate on LGD but all they did the whole time was underestimate OG. They played everything down and lost in the end. That's the mentality of 90% of the dota players I face.
Ceb the tactician. respect
"OG should have just paused the game before the throne went down and ask ""no bb??"". Fking arrogant Chinese players."
17:43 smoking in a restricted area xD
2:15 Joke on Topson He has won nothing after the match He has  fucking Won TI8 🤣😂
"Спилберг, ты должен снять фильм по этой истории."

What a great show. I can imagine like this kind of TV series will be classics in cyber sports of future...
I really like the attitude of Ceb. Ggwp OG
"OG pov is like generic shounen, winning by nakama power up from brink of defeat"
I think the notes won it for OG. You can never be too prepared
"Difference between
MOTIVATION and CRITICISM. 
HELPING and BLAMING.
POSITIVITY and cancer."
"ребята, этот шедевральный фильм, история команды OG и в частности Йохана - лучшее, что я видел или слышал из мира доты за всю свою жизнь! 
после просмотра переполняют эмоции..."
"when you know OG will win then you hear them say ""Go home OG"" hahaha.. feelsgoodman"
What monitor are they using?
The way notail holds the aegis at 59:27 I cant even
500 people were paid by PSG.LGD to dislike this video :D
Notail with a moustache still looks like a kid.
"The joy for OG is immeasurable but the pain for LGD is equally destructive
The beauty of this dota guys"
"I've watched this final 2x times, and 2x times the true sight and all the times I'm getting teary and happy at the same time, amazing final !"

"Im 15 years old ancient 1 looking forward to be one of the immortal players and this is one of my dreams to join and win or lose a TI game i always cheer myself after watching TI games and truesights even tho my parents always say to me that i should stop playing dota 2 because they say its just a game and nothing more than that and i really get sad because i dont have the strenght to talk to them to prove them they we're wrong that dota 2 is not just a game for me this will be the best and golden way to reach all of my dreams 
I wish 8 years from now you guys remember this comment and see how faithful and desperate i am to be a professional dota 2 player and also i wish if you guys read this help me to cheer up myself so in the future if i get the chance to join majors and t.i games i'll thank each and everyone who believe me even im just 15 and none of you have idea of who i am i'll be using the name Panther if i get the chance to join t.i or majors
Thats all i wanted to express after watching dota 2 games and true sights 


Sorry for my bad grammar 
 =)"
41:32 gaben is that you
what were the guys from LGD eating there? 18:18
Smoking's key to winning games boys
Notail smoking near the No Smoking sign just shows he is the real OG.
Left doto for 3 years. Been playing ever since warcraft frozen throne came. Every damn ti true sight brings goosebumps and tears. And the intensity keeps on increasing.
42:10 ceb starts his SPEECH and its AWESOME (Also the music rocks).
Lol n0tail looks a kid smoking 11:45
"I got shivers from this. The players and their stories are so full of heart. Those animations are great, but when Ana stood tall as PL in base I gasped out loud."

I knw this TI final is one of the best finals but TI7 made me cry ....
"Хотелось бы, что бы показали весь их путь на ТИ. Очень хорошее видео! Жаль, что ЛГД так неуважительно относятся к своему сопернику и карма в этом случае сработала аж два раза. Лгд поплатились за свое неуважение и чрезвычайную веру в свою непобедимость, а ОГ выиграли с тренером, который не покинул состав после всех их провалов, и сел играть вместе со своими подопечными за один стол. Такая вера в ,,мертвый состав,, принесла свои плоды. Молодцы ребята! Спасибо за эмоции, которые я испытал, смотря ваши игры на ТИ. После такого в любой игре хочется верить в камбек!"
OMG valve this documentary is out of this world
Como não amar esse jogo ! Pqp.
感觉老子重新看了一遍ti，看到牛魔王单杀时喊nice，看到nmbame没视野tp火锅时直接骂娘，气得老子高血压，不多说，fygod，may皇加油，今年他们的干回来啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！顺便我觉得中国队少个对面那种精神领袖活跃积极性的人物，来个兄弟在低迷的时候tmd吼两嗓子干就完事了啊别nmb一副难受的样子，cndota加tmd油啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊

"39:57 ""Ceb is carrying so hard boys"" I told everyone how Ceb won them this game. It was a team effort and Ana may have done some great plays both in this game and the Ember game, but Ceb played the best Axe of his fucking life here. He was a fucking warrior."
Ehome (Wings 2.0) is coming back!
Play play play
"Ceb is actually so good ,his command is basically on point based on how he read the game and lead the team to victory... and have to say how Fy remain calm and his composure level are so cool..."

lets mute them
Ill mute them once were in game

"Even knowing the results and after watching the finals several times I could watch this without taking a break. The animation was a big plus.
Great video ! Like most true sight, it makes you relive the event. I still do not know if that's something shown for the video or really the way team acts but it feels like the winning team ""looks better"", more chilled out maybe?
Also Seb trying to get the stress out by suddenly getting back to french got me out of the video for a few seconds. It probably does the same to other people earing their langage when they are less represented in dota."
"I dont follow dotA, but for fuck sake I love the OG squad, they all seems to fit perfectly together"
i want sub th please
OG were so positive from start to end. They deserved it no doubt.
Ceb win this)
"i saw LGD taking some pills, what pill is that? (serious asking)"

I'm just so glad china fucking lost. Fuck china.
Kunkka!!! 14:46
The soundtracks in the background are some Interstellar fcking level and they are giving me chills 🔥
Never realized how many of these guys smoke. Makes sense for how much stress they must be under

Positive mental attitude OG!!!
"me after watching this :
""i will eat banana everytime i play dota"""
China №1
42:47  Mastah Sing??!! 😂
LGD players are so arrogant.. and then lose.
Ps- Ceb could write a book on motivation.  Notice all the times he takes someone with amazing potential and helps them push past a mental block or lack of confidence in this series.  Notice how he always keeps his teammates grateful for where they are... even if they lose.  Notice how he keeps people smiling before a match and reminds them that the pain of going another game or enduring another loss is the expectation they should all be ready for.  I’m so glad they released this footage so people can see what a good leader looks like.
"Lesson learned... 



Don't celebrate too early"
No one gonna meme this moment at 5:29?
30:58 PUTAAAAAIIIIN
At the end only miracle ceb and notail the original og member who able to lift the aegis fly? Cr1t? Fuck off bro
Feeling bad for fy
Oppa oppa boys
Did Valve hire Hans Zimmer for the soundtrack ? :O
"ceb indeed a pos3 player, however he is still the team ""coach"" no matter what. OG are the true definition of true teamplay, patience, no crack under pressure and awesome team."
Phoenix vs lina and wyvern animation!! Just wow
39:12 You guys just came to see this.
Teams that win game 1 always lose the finals hahahaha but this isn't finals boi this is GRANDFINALS
China numba 2
every fans watching be like  :O
Ana youre so cute men. 💕
"oh my god, ceb is a really strong positive guy for OG they deserve it"
Thank you for producing this in the correct aspect ratio for new mobile devices!  It’s so nice to see this full screen and not have a notch or camera hole covering shit or the tops of people’s heads being cut off when it’s zoomed lol
38:45 you will want to play it again and again and againnnnn
I feel True Sight giving LGD the shaolin soccer's evil team vibe.
50:48 i bet Jerax says that exact same line during sex hahahahahahahaha
"in my opinion the chinese team are really strong and had a higher chance of winning then og, however they are very showoff and the pride cost them their games."
"""when they are all up just take a slow fight.. a slow fight is all we need.... or kill them?"" DED"
each year is always greater than last year
love the positivity of OG even when they just lost a game they are still striving and lifting everybody up they really do deserve to win 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
42:37 слева Вилат идёт.
"49:46
Zeb: ""Topson Zeus, Ana Ember""
N0tail: ""Johan Prophet, anybody?""
I laughed so hard. The mood of both team was world-apart different. With these two mood makers Zeb and N0tail, OG could even crack a smile in their darkest moment."
"The most nerve wrecking TI finals so far. That PL buyback game 4 and ember eul dodge game 5, amazing performance from ana.
Huge credit for ceb, he should run for president."
Gg! Grats OG
Such a great film but I personally feel like the editing is off. The voice sink in some sections are out.
oh fuck man I love the emotion going on. The cinema when an epic fight comes on and cheering their teammates up every time they get sad on wrong moves. I love it when 7ucking mad always cheers then up. I feel sad tho to LGD. I'm not that sad when this finals happened but seeing their faces so down like that breaks your heart even if your favorite is OG. DAMN </3
"notail is a fuken chainsmoker
btw great documentary though"
14:45 badass
Can someone know the background music they used?
39:58 topson is so right!
PogChamp видос залит с правильным соотношением сторон.
"Notail is the shit, smoking in a non-smoking zone 😂"
I like when the crowd yelling “go home OG” but at the end? HAHAHAHAHHA oh that hurts! hahahaha

the soundtrack is goddamn brilliant. kudos to the audio technician!
"We win together we lose together.

-Ceb"
ANA AND JERAX SAVE TEAM 2vs8 best carry ember pl.!!!
"The added bits of SFM animation of Axe blink-calling and the fight where Ember buys back. Holy shit!!! The whole production quality is amazing. Best use of the word epic. This whole documentary shows what huge determination and psyche it takes to win this tournament, being able to keep calm in such heavily stressful situations where you have to play from a disadvantage. 

 Every DotA player should watch this! We all know how prevalent it is for someone to give up in the game when your team has a bad fight, but just look at the way OG plays off their losses - they don't let it get to their heads at all. Wish more players were like them! PMA

OG's mental game in this documentary is simply exemplary! Very impressed by Ceb's leadership."
"The International 2018, brought to you by Camel"
The ceb show.. This man is just glorious..
"How many times i saw this Finals it's always year Jerking.
As if the loser interview not heart breaking enough.
Then we got this side of LGD.

It's like you can't have two winner but OG really deserves it."
"55:34 ""Ceb it's real.. Cmon ceb, it's real""
I'm not crying.. This is manly tears.."
38:48 that call man
"TI7 - LIQUID

"That’s why we like dota the most. The emotion, satisfaction and our youth. It’s damn worth it. OG OG OG!"
Numbaaaaah waaaaahn trending on gaming
game 4 is nice game ....
One of the best games of DotA I've in a long time. Og fought hard and lgd went all in. I've never been so emotional in a game since this. DotA is such a great game and those who play professionally has my respect. Win or lose
When is TI9 coming?
"And that is why we have the phrase ""failure to prepare then prepare to fail"""
"We lost, so wear your jacket bois."
"Wow! Best truesight, best TI! 

I got chills down my spine!!"
"54:46 I really feel sorry for LGD when I saw that face. 
Powerful, it can make you feel her emotion too"
"Phenomenal! Tears in my eyes! Much respect for Seb, what a Coach"
This was too beatiful guys :’)
PRO PLAYER ITU ROKOKNYA MARLBORO !!!
"Ceb is the one motivating his team to play, encouraging them not to give up, best coach ever in TI."
5:30... lol Love that they're making fun of that shoulder bump by Cr1t...
"I'm glad OG won, the chinese crowd was so cancerous"
"if i woke up in the morning and had to play the ti final, i would play the best dota of my life. If i played my very best ,nothing else would matter. 
-Notail (Manila Major 2016)"
Дайте парню инвокера
17:40 they're smoking in front of a no smoking sign
LGD lost.
56:10 touching moment
Fy is scary when he is on silent mode. MY IDOL
Masterpiece #DotA 2
worst team ever win TI. It's sad
what kind of hoodie that topson wearing?
Maybe has predicted the loss when chalice asked him to take off his jacket. Holy shit 25:22
"dont foget guys even pros can get confused when too many effects on screen , GG ana"
Ada yang merinding nontonnya likee
(Go Home OG) ? are u sure chinese? coz u did..
Komen indonesia disini
41:32 the missing man is fy. He was at down riverside at that very moment
"Well played OG and LGD ., the point is you must control your ego game 4 LGD captain fucked up predicted they will pick gyro and go with morph they give they give them game 4 on a plate from gold and OG not a team give them chance they fights like badass dogs 👏 . Game 5 LGD enter the game with out any souls I’m sad for FY and Maybe . OG you deserve it because you respect your verses team"
"As Michael Bay said: ""That's better than Armageddon"""
Wtf this truesight was AMAZING
54:45 Man i feel for that girl. Her face says it all.
Wake up guys! This got no difference with any others entertainment shit. It's all scenario!
Dota do you even plan on releasing mars??
queremos traductores en español los latinos son mas
ceb is the energy in the booth of og  so postive ....
"notaiL: i have 15,000 hours = 625 whole days of playing dota 2"
Damn this is a masterpiece.
Where's axe? Epic moment....!!! OMG Ceb 38:12
Sweatpants
"I was waiting for this the Whole time
Thank you dota2"
Ceb is really make positive vibe of OG nice to watch
like n0tail said nothing is impossible
"Какой же Се6 красавчик, тупо давал + мораль команде, благодаря которой они выиграли"
"LGD Fans: OG GO Home!
OG Fans: ...

But when OG wins.

LGD Fans: ...
OG Fans: ... Yes!"
omfg yt can you not stop recommending this video to me Jesus i guess ill watch.
Sana pinoy naman nandito soon :(
"Game 5, Ceb asking which hero they want to play instead of counter picking😂😂"
"OG played with heart they had synergy in reallife, true friendship won it"
33:03 NiceLa
Theres no true sight when chinese team wins.
why do chinese lose always at grand final? 😂
"Getting goosebumps watching the critical scenes. 





I almost cried."
"""teams that win game 1 always lose the finals"" 
-FY 😂"
TI Winners is always China vs The World.
Anyone knows the name of the composition that is playing at 1:00:00?
48:28 ana had a doubt about the draft. but ceb keep his confident high. great stuff there from ceb.
"From what I saw, PSG.LGD was ready to win, to take everything. The difference is, OG is ready to lose everything. That's why PSG.LGD was so confident, but not composed like OG."
Expecting TI 9 in Shanghai！
I like how valve focused on the interaction betwen players which we dont see normaly. I mean people saying they didn't show echo dodge and stuff but you can see that in other vids but the interactions and after game discussions showing players spirits is just stunningly beautiful
"Even though I stopped playing Dota 2 years ago, it's still amazing to watch, especially ''True Sight'', just incredible."
"Never Forgive , Never Forget !"
Ceb the motivator. Doesn't matter if we win or lose just play. Damn ceb boost the morale of OG ♡
fy didnt deserve this shit
"I am afraid to open my Dota 2 on desktop, and play it after this documentary. Just won't ruin this feeling :D 
Amazing job, tho. 
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB"
CEB♥
"""Ana, you wanna relo into the base?..
Memes?""

""Fuck off.""

""Bye bye.""

JerAx God certified memer confirmed."
13:00 song same?
fake ti winner
"Damn LGD got it all .
But 1 thing is lacking dor them a "" HEART to motivate them in times of pressure .!! 
In short a CEB"
Chinese don't appreciate notes. See kids what happened if you don't study? You lose TI! </3
"7ckingMad WON 11kk $  BTW, guys"
"55:17 NoTail's NP be like ""How long is this goddamn ancient gonna be I have to take a shit !!"""
45:05 hiyahiyahiya - BigdaddyN0tail
Millions are watching and you casually put the scene where they are smoking.
"Ceb is the best teammate of all time
The mentor, the real captain and the best offlane in dota 2"
Psg fans choked so bad i feel bad for them. Keep on shouting go home og on game 4 hahaha but suddenly cumback by OG mah boysss
58:56 BigDaddy goes insane - TI Madness
n0tail the Dota 2 philosopher
Today is our day -Ceb
I am crying *
"This is a paid game, I watched this live. PSGLGD let OG wins they didn't even atk the heroes or defend base they just call it gg early in 10mins because they are content with 2nd place big money price."
55:13 notail says it all....
hahaha dont worry chinese team TI1000 is yours
Ana like flatface everytime
The best TRUE SIGHT so far...keep it up valve.....and GG OG!!!!
I guess u can see the difference between a team thats in to enjoy the game.. and one thats in just to win..
Go Home OG my ass!
ceb
"Yea, this got me super pumped up! Can't wait to download and play DotA and ragequit after going 0/20/0 in first bot match"
OG (Best attitude and teamwork). Great play. Love OG.  True power of Buyback.
"For me, Ceb is the MVP"
FY GOD
"CNDOTA,BEST DOTA!"
Smoking sessions: 11:26 17:30 24:13 40:50 58:40
LGD didnt lost on skills and strategies but they broke down as a team in the end.
someone knows which music compositions used during the video??
"BigDaddy has to be the most sympathic guy on earth. 

Great Movie."
me salio unas lagrimitas ..en el game 4
Ахуеть.
LGD too overconfident. Serves them right.
Look at all those Chinese fukcers.... 😂😂😂 nubass
"I love it very much when OG win and lose as a team. 
They don't blame others even though they can blame Topson for the 2nd game but they stick as a team and brought up a great victory overall!!
The true team really is OG, they would embolden each other after the 2 rounds defeat.
OG really deserves to win!!! 

P.S. that ES become 7-1 in the end XD"
masterpiece... well played in editing and all... u played with our emotions man.. great job team... u guys deserve a bonus for 10 years.. (y)
"That contrast in each side are both extremely overwhelming. On the OG side, the overflowing emotion of winning while on the LGD side, the deadening silence of defeat. Both are extreme emotions brilliantly captured. Kudos the maker of this video."
Нутейл заслужил!
LGD were gifted players But OG has CEB who keeps on motivating his team. Very optimistic players.
*4:39**  She just crawls ...*
"Topson: 'don't know what to pick'
Ceb: No matter what you choose we're gonna crush them with it.

And they really did crush them. Damn."
"OG was the better team in ti8.
Chinese team should really learn from the heartbroken loss in ti8 which ended the even year law.I felt so bad watching the live final that morning and the whole chinese dota circle shared the pain.
The world dota level is increasing year by year and every team in TI has a chance.That's why we should practice with foreign teams more.
Trust me most chinese are kind and objective so please stop the racist comments.
Chinese teams are improving too and we'll definetly be better next time.
BTY warmly welcome to Shanghai TI9, it's an unbelievable city,and you will really get to know china the great nation and its super hospitable people."
Beautiful Doto
Maybe terrorblade fucked up pretty bad idk... Though kunkka did good holding this ember and also kunkka was a good clever pick.. It wud have been an ez win if TB played little better
"TI7 Blue Theme = Liquid
TI8 Green Theme = OG
TI9 Red Theme = Tigers

#TI9ERS"
The frustration bro
"can u see the differences here? 
european never trash talk.
and asian always.

but LGD used trash talk to spirit their team. soo...."
24:03 He was right :d
What tablets are those that Somnus is taking?
Great job on the making.
"""We are on edge""

Ceb was fcking awesome! He's the mvp of the team.

This is the best True Sight by far. It was an hour long but every second was made well. Lots of takeaways, memeable moments, inspirirational quotes."
"Где субтитры, блять?"
Hey can someone explain why all 5 players in lgd named Paris ???
No wonder the chinese get too sensitive these days.
smoke vs bananas
Amazing video rly
It's all just about mood and motivation)
"10:21 кто то по русски кричит ""СОСАТЬ""!"
Chinese team and their fan are fucking dick. They deserve that.
Dota is life
"Beba Army, PRESENTE"
I love true sight
CEB IT'S REAL -ANA

"From 1-10,what do you think how much did Fly miss to NoTail at this moment ??"

28:01 thia migght be an axe game. Ceb u geniua
LANCHA
"ANA : I DONT EVEN KNOW WHERE IS MY HERO 

i feel u bruh LOL"
This video is a 1-hour meme mine.
"CEB ❤️

I LOVE THE WAY HE MOTIVATES HIS TEAMMATES!"
.
I wish they'd added the bit where Ana sold his acquila for buyback while getting ganked. Overall though it was a tear-jerking glorious hour :D
true sight > infinity war hahaha
"Never give up even when the odds are against you, Lose rate 89% to OG, what a great comeback... too bad they miss the echo dodge tho..."
They should have shown more of LGD's side.
Love the video and the animation is LIT!!
The editing on this is absolutely marvellous..  well played
Wow. They all deserve the ti8! Such heart from OG!
Gaem is ded son
Notail's voice doesnt really suit his face
Big Daddy Ceb
"#feelsbadman for FY !  
#feelsamazing for OG .  Its not over until its over."
WOW
5:41
im waiting for topson to speak
Ceb's papers won TI8
"OG настолько искренняя и общительна команда, что им не важно победят они или не, даже в к конце скзаали ""Охиреть мы выиграли"". Для них и было главным участие, а не победа. Просмотрел на одном дыхании, хотя английский практически не знаю английского"
14:42 GOOSEBUMPS
Ceb's axe gives me goosebumps
"you really deserve it notail, shit i'm crying watching this"
fucking Echo Slam. really calculated without hesitate. sure win Spectre. NOTAIL. for me. HAHAHHA
28:12 that line tho!!
Kids this day don't know what sportsmanship are
Ana the king of facial control
When did Ame speak?
Who watch TI finals again after watching this.
Второй раз переживал за OG. )))))
Those feelings again! Thank you for this vid! OG made Ti8 Grandfinals best in history
i wish it has more animations of teamfights. gives me goosebumps everytime
11:32 is that sumiya?
The power of Flowers and Friendship! 🙌
"If Chinese team lost TI - 55:36

Why am I crying... :'(
"Itu si ana tenang bener pas lagi kondisi terpojok.
Coba kalau gw udah maki maki"
Is it just me who feel sad about the lgd here?
“The one who lose game 1 lose the TI final” the curse continues
"Holy mofetherin damn, the hype, the emotions, the hero picks, two teams so strong yet so diffirent, the tension and the editing. Find me another game this epic, best finals in Dota history. Well done, well bloody done"

3:45 look Notail so much kindness in his heart
Next Chongqing major.... Have a cup of Shaoxing rice wine 🍷
"""go home og""
Oh chinese, not again"
LGD GO HOME
OG's tenacity won them the TI8. I mean the skills the knowledge were there but the decisive factor was their tenacious approach to the game. They were fucking behind from game 2 to 5 still they fck won 2 games out of those 4. They won game 1 convincingly!
"И никакого давления на Томпсона, парень и так зажатый, после третей игры на него смотреть страшно. ""Большой папа"" красава, и Сэб красавцы, весь матч тащили его морально."
"Ceeeeeeeeb he gets the call of his lifetime.
New chat wheel."
36:34 gave me the feels

Please fix this broken game
1 hour of respect for Ceb ... 😊😊
Axe - CEB destroy game 4
59:46 i've found my life purpose!
Someone commend ODpixel for commentary... Nobody can be better than him...
"so fucking emotional :"""""""")"
Its make more happy when i see that kind of Face of a Chinese's is so devastated... Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahaha
BRING BACK OPEN AI!!!
3:22 was that a colostomy bag?
Where is Tobi?

52:52
Naruto won.

Damn I watched the whole 1hr clip and idk how!!?
"God, I hate Somnus"
"""win or lose, we play"" that's mentallity"
"Their couch are really good in motivating, good job OG."
25:24 Dont Jinx us.
You need a ceb and a notail in your team who's optimist that what they dont have in LGD
That Axe though
"""holy crap Ceb is holding a bunch of papers "" 💀💀💀💀"
"I love how ceb was, on drafting phase when topson said he likes invoker, ceb does not even hesitate eventho on topson poor performance on invoker in game 2...ceb just said ‘give him his invoker boys’"
"""we lose? idc... we play!!!!"" -ceb"
Music is so sick!
Хотел бы посмотреть на тех людей которые дизлайки ставят
The way Ceb motivates his teammates when they're having a hard time in their lanes was awesome. He's the real mvp la.
Fuck the goosebumps from ti8. It's all coming back. Thank you so much for this. I love it. I really do.
This video gave me butthurt about cunts wining TI8 once again LUL
All those Dislikes coming from Chinese
Reason why og won is that their team have better team spirit. Thats a fact
Topson. Its nothing before.. but look it that.. they are win :v
NoTail == Fix it Felix
I've already watched this so many times. goosebumps!
This is because these flowers 🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻
"Wow
LGD, they r so arrogant.
LGD to OG : they r no where near us 
OG to themselves : we r winner even if we lose
Girl, that was a huge different"
too much cheese :>
"Not enough communication on LGD's side, both tactically and emotionally."
14:44 scary moments OMG
"Here's what a TI winner advice:

Always fucking watch ABC videos"
36:00 i love how they made PL like the last boss 😂
Good luck next year LGD <3333
Actually Ana sell some small item to have buyback before the roshan fight. They shud show this..
Everytime I see ceb's papers I just remember that dotawatafak Ana + Spec = TI8
"The guy who said ""if you win, take off your jacket"" is the reason why lgd lost the game."
lol oppa oppa boys
Ceb is purely positive that’s why he won.
love it
Why didnt i see the jerax es game arc warden topson wtf

Redbull vs psg Pog
2:44 that bastard was watching previous Dota matches of the opposing team & as soon as he saw the camera he pretended to watch some random video.

"Im ready for win

gg ez. psg can't buy any title.
17:35 n0tail smoked in front of no smoking sign? xD
"Про путь , который прошёл этот состав, особенно Себ и Нотейл можно фильм снять"
Is ceb a prophet? We are being tested guys.
"Og play communication. But, lg didn't😐 that's why they lose..."
Gave me goosebumps again and again and again
Tusk King is Sing2x
"where to download music from this movie? we need ""ost"" pack"
amazed how they dont give up
didnt include ana's pl aquila sell. for shame.
35:57 PL 25 guys..
"Well, still feel sad for lgd. Congrats to OG, they deserve this championship. Ceb condenses the team"
"Amazing work Valve, made me in tears"
37:24 silenced LGD crowds
"Sure PSG. LGD WILL WIN THIS.......







IN YOUR MOTHER FOKIN DREAM MAAAAAAAAAAAN

OG MADE IT"
5:30 was he talking about cr1t bumped his shoulder on the backstage before ?
"this should be in the big screen dammit, goosebumps everywhere!"
9:58 Nice!😂😂😂
"When LGD was having a hard time against OG at game 4th, while OG was just having fun playing the game together !! 39:17 Ana the best .. i can't even see my hero ! xD"
12:29 anyone can explain what kind the language
11:32 ORA NGUDUT ORA MENANG
GG
This is why we love Dota2. My all time favorite.
Best frends Wins!
"14:43 Somnus Said : ""Kunkka"" ..

Navi comeback gg
Damn even i already know OG will win but this one is fkin lit
Чёта изявая
13:11 Ceb is motivating them and all of us.
Это лучший TI в истории.Такое надо в кинотеатрах показывать.Столько эмоций!)
До мурашек просто. Нет слов.
Fy carried their asses and still lost
did they ask hans zimmer for the back ground music??!!! amazing
The ending 😭
55:43 teary eyed somnus. I feel you bruh.
They can predict whos gonna ban and pick
ame is like a ghost. no one knows he was there. haha
"52:39
This moment could definitely be done better with actual RP animation. I was really disappointed but the rest is awesome anyway"
Someone will make a compilation of those new SFM for sure.
"An incredible portrayal of one of the most amazing series of all time!
I'm overwhelmed with emotion and ecstacy AND I DON'T EVEN PLAY DOTA!

A truly worthy world finals.
Major props to ceb!
The sheer unwaivering confidence and strength with which he leads and inspires his team, he's my new no.1 Captain!"
"i change my mind. Last year i said the ""True Sight TI7"" was the best. But now...

THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST. NICELY DONE, VALVE! I LOVE IT"
Is this esports game of the year?
Шото хуйня!
What is that inside LGD's jacket?

"Thank god they cut the part when they hugging awkwardly. Btw, this gave me goosebumps."
"Notail udud surya
Surya for ti winner !"
Slark is good at the first match of OG and LGD.. To counter spec or somethin plus winter wyvern
"14:52 

BRING BACK OPEN A1!😂"
Ceb's conversations are amazing
Where's Fly? Haha
"They lost because nobody was a real captain in the team calling the shots... They forced meta into rosh pit and didn't get the rosh in game 5, it all went bad from 1 fight... If there was a captain to call of smokes and shots, it would have been different, they need someone like ceb in the team... Ember zeus is shit, literally shit hero in that patch, they got raped early and managed to equalize and win when lgd basically forced a failed rosh attempt... Unnecessary risk... And game 4 was lost, because of broken PL lvl 25, they didnt realize how OP PL lvl 25 was and needed to force something before PL lvl 25... It's like mega creeps, you can't let that happen or else 70-80% you just lost the game...

Paper was a mental warfare playing mind games, paper was a useless decoy to get them out of their feets... EG would have smoked OG if they were given the chance to fight near the end of the tournament... PSG was a far stronger team, I feel sorry for them..."
"35:56 ""У них проблема: У нас пл 25"" Стоит и круто смотрит. Уххххх"
31:00 Vive la France :D
39:16 even a champ can't see his hero.

Wow
"41:49 when someone asks me ""Wats the last thing u gonna do before u die"""
28:14 that axe destroyed that so called tusk king though

It was awesome being there and seeing it on person! Some say it was the best TI so far and I'm really glad I could be there.
443 dislikes from LoL player?
OG the trust they have in each other is amazing. beautiful doto.
GG guys
"1 hour, worth the time worth to watch...

glad i watch it
and i glad u guys spend the time to create this masterpiece"
"Can we have the True Sight of EG vs OG?

I mean, we need some honest words from n0tail to fly
“Go to hell betrayer!!!”"
5:30  they talking about Cr1t the douchedog
i still get nervous even if i know that OG will win lol
I still felt anxious for OG. Even though I knew they won. Damn this stuff so intense. <3
R.I.P keyboard
Фантастическое видео!Спасибо!
17:39 the most badass notail smoking on a no smoking area <3
Очень круто. Глянула на одном дыхании
Я не знаю что со мной за этот час в душе произошло.Но эти эмоции  и это переживание ... Спасибо Габен. Спасибо Notail.
Music used?
"9:44 AHAHAHAHAHAH
Chinese and american"
"TI only for true gamers, not for arrogant one."
39:54 AYAYA
"OG mentality wins the game from the start..they play to have fun not to win..what they say is true, ‘lose together, win together, slay together, slay together, slay together’..psg.lgd had their vision tunnel to just winning but regards players mental state"
THIS IS SO SAD :( I REALLY FEEL FOR LGD.
55.19 i need that gif! ASAP
"12:42 yeah, try say that to Liquid"
Disaster for Chinese squad. like Newbee destroyed by liquid.  So much pain
"I will keep cheering on fy , he is the player who deserve an TI aegis in his lifetime"
fy is the beast but OG deserved it like no other. N0tail ily
"I still don’t understand how OG won g4 or turned around g5.
Still feel bad for Maybe and fy. Gods!"
Too epic.... i was cry
"if only they can make vids like this, but for OG vs EG"
this is supposed to be a fun video. not a tear jerking one
31:45 potaaanggg
11:33 Zai?
why i cant find the video on youtube ? 1:00:00
"Go home OG? Yeah, more like ""go home OG with Aegis of Champion"""
Насколько же Валв ахуенная компания.
when every game ends ceb always goes for the bannna
i love this game
"Я прям почувствовал эти эмоции, Себ молодец все время заряжал команду энергией, даже когда проиграли 2 игры подрят, он все равно говорил что они выйграют. Уфф, прикол в конце все с открытыми ртами смотрят))))"
"PSG LGD mindset : f*ck them we're gonna win this.
 Somnus : Holy sh*t, whats on those papers."
ana paling kalem wkwk
"I've watched this TS probably 3 times now, and I've got to say, aside from the amazing production value, the sound design done in this was amazing."
kontol
Who would've thought the Frenchman had the strongest resolve to win.
Those animations for game 4... oh my lord!
N0tail fucking deserved the Aegis
38:40 *FIRE*
"Nice Docu Valve, now please fix CS:GO you pieces of shit."
Вместо игровых моментов вставляли анимационные которые очень важны. Зачем?????
Very wellplayed
NOtail done well ! so he never give up ! true DOTA winner !
11:32 Zai
"3-я игра закончилась, а противостояние только началось"
animated scenes was so doope
I think this is good but they missed some good turning point moment like Ana sold item for buy back when PL was dying.
9:21 that fuckin ES ECO!!! REACTION
Felt like they made Ana look like aui2000. A guy who left a ti winning team and don’t need him
"25:19 whats that all about??whats underneath those jackets??whats their play??honestly i hate some inside game their playing..if ur representing psg.lgd, play for them properly..dont win and show ur on another team or something, but if u lose then put the blame on psg.lgd..thats an ass move..if they have badass wordings on their backs or something, show it from the start, dont be pussy n show it when its needed..this is not a magic prediction show.."
"Thank you Valve, such a video <3"
"fuck man, so goooddd"
Под конец не выдержал и зарыдал) Какой же охиренный TI 8 всё-таки был.
CEB PEOPLES MVP MAN! BEST CAPTAIN SO FAR!
38:39 famous last words
nice..nid tht speach like dat ceb....raise the motivation..da chinese team just think how to win while og..thy think overall..have fun and raise da beserk xD
What is the soundtrack start from minute 54:10 untill they pick the aegis? Anyone knows?
"wp for ceb. trying to encourage his team and giving his 100 percent trust to them, kodus to him and to team OG. you deserve to win"
А это что ле не русский канал?
see guys dont pick redbull just pick a banana :D
GOOSEBUMPS EVERYWHERE! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK MAN!
"Ceb's a great player, game 4 is one of the best i've seen"
"PSG players were too arrogant , after the finals starts."
"13:14 ""they dont give a shit,these guys are fucking warriors"""
Goosebump
WTF 18:25 what are those pills they're taking???
mad respect for both teams. going through all that emotional rollecr coaster while staying composed.
"When the PSG.LGD fan said ""Go home OG""
And it turns out that OG claim the Aegis
They should be shame of themselves"
Congrats Dota number 1 trending on gaming
Congrats Dota number 1 trending on gaming
Where the fuck is ame? Hahaha
Holy crap ceb is holding a bunch of papers hahahahahah
Yo shit man i dont even play dota anymore and this shit made me cry like a bitch man
Did they use age of empires building sword sound for taking down the last ancient wew
Man I wish SEA Players all act and react like Ceb. Much respect for this dude and OG.
Спасибо за Такие эмоции
http://paydepth.com/?userid=97445
OMG THIS IS SO INTENCE
31:00 n0tail
"Ceb : "" Guys, win or lose, we don't care, we play. "" what a word. I'll keep it in my mind forever."
"who first win in final, they will lose, lol og is win"
"Пиздец сначала так волнительно , как будто сам играешь! А в конце трогательно 😫"
singsing xNova
""" I mean, I don't even know what the fucks is going on, I can't even see my hero""
-From a Ti8 Champion OG.Ana"
"'Lose together, win together, slay together, slay together, slay together.  Let's do it guys. '
The most inspiring word from ceb that make them to be a winner."
That N0tail speech in the end made me cry
10:03 Messi?
What a great leader. n0tail for MVP. Always cheering up his team no matter what.
Brutal!
Im sad for Fy...
"A brilliant master piece - the only problem is that I once again feel bad for PSG.LGD. I routed for OG and was ecstatic that they won, but now I feel the pain of LGD. 

I suppose that's Dota - there is always one winner and one loser - we love the winners but I think we all feel the hurt of the losers... GG WP"
Ceb is the real MVP. GO OG <3
"55:13 really deserved it man, mad props"
17:41 notail smoking next to no smoking sign
True Sight for Eg vs Og please!
Love it
"smoking in the  ""no smoking zone"""
Это был лучший финал в истории Доты!!!
Why all Chinese teams are  arrogant
0:02-0:12 sound please
"No smoking , but smoke.. Lul 17:40"
what sound in first second movie?
Is it china named dot heroes with their own language? I didnt hear any hero mentioned in their conversation
Go home LGD
Why there is no true sight of dodge echo slam by ana ember?
"Man, hardwork really pays off."
"There is this meme of OG picturing 5 of them quoted ""OG's power at 100%""
And then the picture of Ana alone ""OG's power at 99%""
Fam lets not forget how Ceb single handedly saved their asses to the finals. Not just mentally, we saw in this video how he lifts up their spirit on desperate times, Ceb's leadership was glorious
""He gets the call of his lifetime"""
I need ceb as my coach T.T
"LGD:Go home OG
OG:yes with the aegis😎"
38:40 thank me later..
Damn that phoenix egg with lina was some next level production shit
"42:49 I somehow thought he was talking about penis size:D
Chinese sorry, I didn't mean to offend you"
CEEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBBB!
why not include ana eul scepter himself to dodge echo slam..
fy 😢😭😭😭😭😭
"The problem with China, they take things way TOO seriously, gets competitive for every little thing. LMAO, they say fcuk u nerd when they are winning, when they are losing they went total mute. Cockiness peeps don't last. But good game to both teams!!"
Jerax lost it when they started speaking French lmaoooo OG is the true PSG team
memes
"wow! game 5, OG didnt even go for strategies and synergies in their pick. They just pick it like ""What do you want to play? Ok let's play it."" in their every pick of that game. Just enjoying it. Really deserved the aegis."
try not to cry......  cry a lot😭😭😭
Is it worth if i just yolo there ?
"55:39 ""I think I might have left the stove on..."""
Their different perspectives of the game is really something
I love somn'us gesture
Big daddy no tail: i want only best dota 😍
28:14 THE MOMENT BEFORE DISASTER.
I love ceb. I'm amazed on how ceb constantly stays positive in every situation. No matter winning or losing
Ceb is the heart of OG . i still fighting while got downed
We are on the edge- ceb
433 chinese dislikes and counting hahaha
Topson real lucky guy

Ceb et les insultes 😂
CHINA NUMBER 2
"Scroll down and ignore, SPOILER: 






OG WON"
"I Don’t even understand what’s going on. I can’t see my hero
-Ana 2018."
Common'... Ana dodged the echo slam.... put that epic scence in.. .. !!!!
Ахуенный трусайт.Такие эмоции получил
THIS GAME IS EPIC THAN THIS GAME https://youtu.be/3qq-V20eD0Y
17:36 Notail breaks the rule Kappa
Maybe is probably my favorite in LGD after watching this true sight. He seems like a cool guy to play with.
"Unreal the skills they all have. I wish I was that good but I work to much . Good job everyone good to see these tournaments pay good not $10,000."
i don't know but it's kinda like me and notail like tosmoke after every game . lmao . hahahaah
"Johan is the captain
Ceb is the coach
And three others is prodigy"
why lgd look like a bad guys in chinese movie?
"37:29 Jerax - ana do you wanna relo in the base?
Ana- Fuck off
Jerax- bye bye"
Ceb the best PMA player ever!! Fuck Dude
OMG THOSE ANIMATIONS ARE SO LIT
Что нахуй с форматом видео? и где 4к?
14:46 Kunkaaaaa😈
CEEEEEEEEEEEB
"Chao ni maa, magic word 🌈"
"Интересно, насколько Fly пожалел, что ушел от Нутейла?"
i cant count how many time's ceb say's the F word
*#1 TRENDING ON GAMING BOIS!*
"FY:im a tusk king...

Laugh in singsing...lmao"
show my respect OG!
Why topson in og he just feeder
Cull.  Cull.  The CULL of his lifetime.  Who subtitled this?
Spanish subtitule plis
So does someone count how many is it that Topson being dead and the camera focusing on him
what did notail and 7ckngmad say after jerax sing thats the way uh huh uh huh i like it ?
"that fy's face when OG win, so emotionless yet I can feel a thousand of emotion from it"
Самый уёбищный турик в мире. А все в мире считают его вери ахуенным из-за комментаторов которые спизданули ЧТО ЭТО ЛУЧШЕЕ ЧТО ОНИ ВИДЕЛИ. Ебаный мусор
legends
No OG's road towards finals? NO OG VS EG? No showing hw people legit downvoted OG and how OG stunned all? Well then its just good enough i guess
37:54 jebaited
"44:06 “Lose together, win together, slay together, slay together, slay together”"
Докеры хуесосы кста
I feel my tears dropping
I think we ready for Dota Movie ...
LGD.Somnus will never take his jacket off. Haha
Ana dodging echo is not shown. whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
"OG team is more like a leadrship while the LGD is the bossy one, a huge reason of winning wp"
"in only 24 Hours, i have watched this clip for more than 7 times!"
I fell bad for fy. He really deserved to lift the Aegis.
CER.MIKE spectre is really good
"comeback game ? Yes .. comeback series ? Yes …...Comeback Whole Tournament and lift the Aegis ? YESSSSS!!!!
This is hv something like TI7 Final about Chinese and EU Attitude  China always serious pressure and cant except a mistake while EU just ride or die Win or Lose dnt give a fuck just play have fun no blame enjoy every moment even they lose or win :D"
"14:45 sounds like ""bankai"" 😅"
man fy looks like a solid as fuck 10/10 model when he smokes. no gay talk here
"I think everyone in OG is the MVP, each one of them have a job to done, and single one of them finish it very well.

Every single one of them can't be like that if the other on the team do the wrong things. Everyone of them suits in very well as a team."
55:15 минута рубик в аркане... совпадение ? Не думаю ...
"I like how OG was just like ""Wanna play that hero? Sure, why not?"""
"Not 1 player mentions the money, pure love for the game. SOOOOO much respect. Great video, OG, what a story, what an amazing TI. No one deserved it more than N0Tail."
The moment CEB came and rescue ana had me tears
lol lgd said team that win game 1 always lose ti but liquid just 3-0 last year
19:40 synchronized xD
"""Holy crap, Ceb is holding a bunch of papers."" It was this moment he knew, they fucked up."
"Жалко Fy, он все делал для победы... Он был достоин победы"
"fy :they dare to pick axe in front of tusk king????? 
Ceb: but im the axe king !!!!"
fuck you china!
"ceb is very positive. . .
what a fighting spirit. . 
we win together . we lose together.
We slay together
we slay together
we slay together"
Lgd's mindset is the reaaon wjy they lose. Cocky bastards

bangkitin dota2
"I trust your fucking ember. WE ALL TRUSTED YOUR EMBER, ANA"
So fun watching china bois go down 😂 feels good..
Spoiler alert! OG won.

"Bruh, riot's music industry vs valve's film industry."
Man this shit is so fucking goood!
"Did i just cried 😥, game 4 was a game changer"
Notail smoke :(
wait just me come from indonesia ? IND
So emotional
Dumbasses kicked your asses lol
Best True Sight So far.. Good Job!!
"I can’t imagine what’s on NoTail’s mind when he hugs the aegis, it’s full of emotion"
"Все кто пишет в комментарии мол ""Рубик выиграл TI , а вы его хейтите"" 
Выиграл не рубик , а команда .
Не рубик хорош, а игрок на рубике."
Ceb is a hero
It legit make me cry during ceeeeeeeeb
"damn theyre really predicting everyones moves and drafts , dota is really all about pyscology"
Damn Ceb's motivation is the best!
Honestly. Not jerax not topson is the mvp here its ceb. He is so positive its like he doesnt care whether they win or loose. ‘Just Play and enjoy ‘ -ceb
i am OG fan but I almost teared for LGD
ceb moment is the fcking best!  i feel the real anger to help the team on team fight..
I feel you fy you did everything youve got
Wow i dont know if fy a smoker.
HEEEEEE GEEEETSSSS THEEEE CAAAAAALLLL OOOFFF HIIIIS LIFEEEETIIIIMMEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!
This is Dota
"I cried while watching this. I was a fan of EG and OG, and supported their games all throught out. Ceb's preach made me bawl my eyes out. Glad that they have a man like Ceb, full of good thoughts, gave them best advices, and supported his whole team even treated them as his own brothers and sons. Im just, just feeling ecstatic even up to now. Im sorry. It's just that, all the hard work paid off. And to notail, I knw that guy had some serious issues with his former teammate not to mention the name and even got shoulder locked by crit. But look how far a being down to earth person made. 
Ps. This is the best TrueSight so far. <3"
45:23 Do you think ember is good? -Ana
"55:15 absolute goosebumps,  must be so satisfying to win, they deserved it."
54:32 . They know theyre fuckd up
По сути две последние катки Аne разьебал их .Все таки Китайцы монстры))
"I need sub thai

"mati kau somnus, mangkonyo jangan cak macak njingg"
"All axe animation was amazing 👏
Like if you agree"
"""Where's the axe? ...... . .(Ceeeeeeeb!! "")

Oh,  there you are."
52:13 oh dear..
we want true sight on netflix.

"SEB не реально поднимает мораль в команде, очень хороший капитан"
Best TI ever.
"50,000 hours of Dota Pay off <3 BigDaddyNoTail <3"
LEADERSHIP
"Everyboys here, get to fuck out to look for a girlfriend or friends, u don't gonna be a pro player. THIS IS NOT THE REAL LIFE, STOP TO BE PLAYING THIS GAME A LOSERSSSSS"
Fy- you deserved this TI champions
n0tail is a hero
"I need to express my feels for N0tail. plz listen

From reddit, five years ago"
"Суки Вальве, умеют же на слезу пробить!"
The best TI. The best True Sight
Lol how badass is notail smoking on non smoking zone haha
game 5: where is the moment when ana dodge the echo slam?? im waiting for it but its not included in the video zzzzzzzz
"I know, I'm not the only who cried watching this."
Flower power
i love the animations
4:15 the music and the entries... WOW
holy shiet
"10:20 - Когда лгд возварашаються челик кричит ""СОСАТЬ"""
Ceb true Leader and guru for OG. Mad respect for him
24:22 Can we talk about NoTail not giving a fuck about the clump of kids behind him lol
Gaaaaaaa
41:49 i want to play play play play play dota you can see that you Just cant leave dota
Jerax is god

I am actually crying T_T
oh my godd :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Ceb stayed cool AF.... just kept everyone intact
O.G mentality
im pretty sure notail finished an entire pack of cigarettes that day
17:40 BigDaddy sees the no smoking sign but still gives zero fucks
20:11 CAO NI MA
"PSG.LGD: Teams that win game 1 always lose the finals
*OG* *WON*
PSG.LGD LEFT THE CHAT"
I wish there was a True sight in TI3.
I cant even see my hero #AnaJoke hahaha
xNova warding next level
"Johan smokes after every game, Ceb grabs a banana. Little did you know he also smokes, his favorite brand to smoke is PSG.LGD. With ANA's ember lighting them up :D"
First
"JUST ENJOY,  KEEP CALM AND WIN THE INTERNATIONAL"
Ceb is like Avenger's Captain 7cking  America in terms of commands and boosting the morale of his team mates
So much respect for Ceb
The difference is leadership.
Congratulations OG Your The Best Go home Psg.Lgd
I TRUST U'R FUCKING EMBER !!
CEEE-E-E-E-E-E-B!!! its SO FUCKING EPIC
"Ceb is the man
LGD boring"
Key to win TI. Lessen pressure and just enjoy the game.
"Ceb act like a captain!,He is so confident,positive and humble! And how he trust his team's ability! give love on him and his team <3"
Lovin the face of somnus after losing... Haha
"""Guys, win or lose, we don't care, we play"" -ceb"
Other then toxic community there is no other fun and challenging game as dota 2.
"мощнейшее видео. если у меня от инта такие сильные эмоции, то что уж говорить про игроков)"
shoutout to OG for winning me $500 at ti8
The most shocking part of this was finding out that notail snokes
"Oh its so funny when you understand both language. They actually had to tone down the Chinese vulgarities. At 20:12 , they were mentioning that Ceb was looking at his notes again. Then they proceeded to curse his Mum. Feelsbadman."
"Game was extraordinary. Pitiful LGD lost, but OG well played."
"best part of the video, ''
''Johan we won TI''
Johan stares at him for a few seconds, says nothing.. then bursts out laughing out of pure disbalief and shock.
what a great bunch of guys who came in an underdogs and left Topson dogs. 

GG wp"
Focus on spectre hh
"ceb its real! its real
but ye he pretty much wont his for them, i thought he was the captain from this"
we need the soundtrack mix!!!! like this comment to get more votes
The more i watch dota2 documentary like dota archives and true sight the more i admire n0tail
Lmao 7cking mad hugging relatives and notail hugging aegis
"if i could super like this, i would"
Chinese fans faces tho
*goosebumps
i dont like chalice attitude. hope fy gets better teammates
Dont celebrate too early LGD bois
The Ceb mentality. Every Dota2 player must have this kind of mind set and attitude.
Chalice and somnus.. The overconfident bastards..
man. ana is a beast.
wtf with that chinese face lol. chill like og man
I love Fy's keyboard👍
"I strongly believe that if I woke up in the morning and I had to play the TI final 
I would play the best Dota of my life and that’s all I would matter to me. 
If I played my very best… nothing else would matter.  
-N0tail"
36:02
dude I felt a tear when LGD lost on rosh pit :((
37:27
memes? xD
"I wish they do more of that 36:34-36:45, switching between in-game animation to the actual fight scene. That Ceeeeeeb highlight later looks good for non-Dota player, but to me, it doesn't have that much impact compares to what really happened (not to mention that they skip his disengage several seconds before, imo this is really important). The Magnus + Ember at Roshan pit on game 5 shares the same impression. And no emphasis on Ember's Eul moment is a big miss too."
holy shit lol the picking phase inside the booth is surprisingly hostile... shit talking and dissing the other team
"28:09 ""you're gonna see some shit""
 And see some shit we did, Ceb you fucking beast"
Fucking ceb he hug ana's sister
Ceb! you're fucking awesome!
Great production holy F
Pardon me for being rude but seeing that global silence from the chinese felt really good.
"I saw the sign ""No smoking"" and Notail was like: Screw it!  24:23"
OG's mental game is so good
This is the Best True Sight T18 Champion i ever See ... its so Dramatic
#INDOPRIDE. mana nih?
dislike needs more artour
man only just now i realize how ceb play his role perfectly! true mvp . only know after watching this video
The best TI 😊
Waited so long for true sigh... finally!
"Roses are Red
Violets are Blue
I play Rainbow Six
But I watched this Dota 2"
LGD的比赛态度好随意
"I like the moment 39:23 when Ana wants to go for yolo and other og members like ""OK, up to you."""
This wasn't a mismatch of skill level like Liquid v Newbee...The will to win carried these guys through...OG just refused to lose.
Never won TI is LGD! How comes?
Как же fy сексуально курит
You can see the positivity by the OG thats the key feature to win
this makes me want to play dota so bad then 40 mins later I REGRET EVERYTHING !!!
"Its all about mind setting and attitude..look at how OG handled their losses and motivated each other especially somebody gets upset. They're not blaming one's fault yet they're embracing it...What an attitude, that is why they really deserved the Aegis."
Where's Notails girlfriend?
hahaha ok for the win
5-man RP @55:36-@55:55
1M views in a day
"Denmark, the land of fairy tales"
"12:43 ""teams that win game 1 always lose the finals ?"" hahahaha take it fy, karma is real and the reason why og win cause they are just want to play ! not to win ! they dont care if they are losing"
It's SAVE not CEB.
it would be excellent if there were story about the betrayer (Fly & S4) hahaha
You can feel the pressure just by watching.
Notail deserves more than anyone he tried so many times and im literally happy for him
"smoking on a no smoking sign, we got a badass over here lol"
Ахуенное видео. Спасибо

Fuckingmad GOD!!!!!!!!!!
55:36 really sad moment for fy

Wow
Ceb was just always happy and positive. I guess it really is better to grow in the Free West than live in Communist Shit Country who instills Nationalism and General Dickiness in its people.
Ceb is the behind the scene team captain of OG
Fuck n0tail deserves this so much
whats name of song at 7:00 boys
Holy shit this is beautiful

"True sight should be on cinema, really not for free viewing totally amazing slowclap*"
"Fcking crazy Ceb, he is the real leader, the real motivator, the real champion, Congratz OG team u deserve it 😁

Big fans of Ceb here 😆"
How? I didn't get bored clap! Clap++
We need True Sight on ODPixel. His passion is unparalleled.
Ceb's mentality man. holy shit.. the real MVP
"Este video es epico. Uno aprende mucho en su constante comunicación. 

La mejor final que he visto en mi vida!"
Nice captain..very strong PMA.they have nothing to lose ..thats how they win the last match..brilliant play by og
54:45 PEPEHANDS
Quería ver la lo que paso mas a fondo entre notail y fly
Any loss especially with kunnka is so depressing Ik
Эй Нутейл ! Иди нахуй !
This could be great if Tobiwan was the caster. ODpixel is great but Tobiwan is the God of all casters
Sad. They don't have clip for the ember echo dodge
That take off your jacket after we won didnt happen. Hahahahahaha
LOL crit shoulder bump? @5:30
"What a great fucking job you done on it guys.. Congratzzz, it's so interesting to watch."
CADÊ A LEGENDA EM PORTUGUÊS?
"I'm a french and all my support goes as a matter of fact to OG, throughout the storytelling behind this win etc... But during this trie sight i've been like mesmerised by the fy's aura, this Guy IS really something else.. like a refreshed version of puppey with even more intensity.. i'm pretty sure that Ceb and fy will encounter again and it will be more and more epic"
Lmao LGD got cocky after game 3
THE BAGUETTE CARRIES
"I love dota, I don't even play it but I love watching it."
"deep down in n0tail's heart , he miss fly"
Its always nice to have a teammate like ceb to pick you up when its seems all is crushing down
i just noticed 37:30 jerAx said 'Ana you wnt to relo into the base? memes?' tfw hahahahaha and the funny thing is they actually did it.
55:44 Sad! 😯
Maybe next time Maybeee.. too much talking HAHAHAHAHA TUSK KING
"NOTAIL:OH MY GOD!!!
JERAX: ANA YOU SO FUCKING CUTE MAN"
"OG loses game 3
Ana: it doesn’t matter
Boss😂"
dota 2 sucks put dota 1 on steam
I don't why but I clicked the replay button.
"FY was really good! No doubt, one of the best support."
我们辉煌过，我们低沉过，2019，我们卷土重来，CNdota bestdota
SWEET
"Well Played OG , and Well Played Fy God"
38:24 shoookt. Jaws Drop

36:34 Coooooooooooool
this guys are insane they are all came to claim that KUNGFU PANDA HAT
DIE LGD DIEEEEEEEEEEE
And still people saying they won by luck.
Ceb swearing in french is the most hilarious thing ever
"this made me want to play dota again!! great and awesome video. LGD was amazing but OG came out of nowhere, ceb with the optimism and leadership. It was the best thing i have ever seen!!! NoTail deserved it and when I was watching this live stream, i honestly thought lgd got it during game 4 but OG never gave up! Ana with the ember in game 5 along with ceb's positive outlook, win or lose they played like they normally would. They had fun and they got the Aegis!"
LGD 上海赢回来！
its a replay man! but still gives the gbumps out of me!! scary fuck man.. ana's demon ember!
How to lose a grandfinals...buying rod of atos on batrider.
"For me, Jerax the most chilling guy in OG. He smiled in the entire tournament lol. He even made jokes in knockout game 4. 
Notail and Ceb always stay positive and hype. They made the team out of pressure. Just chill my  bros!"
quando vai sair a legenda em português? T_T
Goosebumps!
"Pongan subtitulos en español mierda , particularmente puedo interpretar el ingles sobre todo en contexto de dota2 , pero de todas maneras que no exista subtitulos en español es algo racista..."
5:50 Good laugh LOL
Y los subtitulos para español valve? Donde estan los subtitulos para español?
MAYBE NEXT TIME
One million
Simply The Best Documentary Ever. well played for everyone behind the scenes.
I сryed.
"too much talking CHINA players LOL...  ""team will win the game 1 will lose the finals"" LOL HAHAHAHA"
Ceb's voice its like gorgc voice haha

"GO HOME PSG.LGD, GO HOME Nuubi"
Spoiler: Na'Vi won
18:20 what are those pills?
39:16 This is so me. hahaha
Comeback is reallll... Fuckinggg good OG!!! Nice and wellplayed. Congratss OG!! #notail #ana #topson #Jerax #Ceb

what kind of idiots dislike the effort put in making of this video?! dare you to show yourself.
Its not spectre that badass..its fucking ana
"Long wait for 1 hour production?




*I ain't mad at that!*"
I cried
"This is epic, intense, and brilliant ❤️❤️"
Cried watching this masterpiece
GIVE THE BOY INVOKER
"Watch True Sight get hyped asf, go game pick mid fail/feed.
gg end fast."
"30:56 Ceb litterally sais ''Go fuck your mother, son of a bitch!'' and then repeats it again. Idk why they censored it. It's just the mindset every high lvl team is in when it's time to rumble."
ANA WAS THE REASON TO ALL THE VICTORIES THEY HAD RT
Invoker is a pig bro
Gay
"CEB's Attitude is amazing .. he is really optimistic and confident in the team
and Notail hit 15 thousand hrs in dota  during this final :D"
"I fking cried when someone kept saying""Ceb, its real!"""
First time saw BigDaddy was back to 2010 when he was playing HON.  I like his baby face and the way he treat ppl and the game.  Happy for his achievement.
notail and cebs optimism kept this team:)
Ceb and Notail really motivated the team. Damn gives me goosebumps watching this.
Fuck that Fly....fucking usless in OG. Without him was the true strenghtof OG.
"THE POSITIVITY, THE LEADERSHIP, THE COMMUNICATION, THE TRUST IN YOUR TEAMMATES = TI8 CHAMPION.
CEBBB!!!~~"
"*long inhale....*
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB"
I fucking love it
"New chat wheel!

35.59 i got goosebumps to see that PL levl 25 animation. ana is coming for Lgd. so damn coool this truesight. thanks vlave
pa cuando en estañol?
"I don't play Dota2, but I used to play the first Dota and HoN. Now I'm playing LoL. And this was just an amazing journey to watch! TI is probably the best tournament each year! Can't wait until next one! Keep it up dota2 <3"
great edit
"39:57 what a nice hug, love this guys"
"sorry boys, china is numba 2 now"
когда русская озвучка буит?
Manila Major Best Major HAHAHA
"cried like a little bitch in the end, thanks Gabe"
Best TI ever . Full of drama . Got the best ending .
Like si te gusto.
38:40 amazing moment
"goosebumps whole time watching, holy shit"
"Mute and lose , bye chinese noob"
"3:37 Someone says ""Don't get beat mid"".100% confident that cost them the series. Who the HELL SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT? Anyone know who said that?"
"This is the most beautiful things i ever seen in 2019...

*WOW* What a masterpiece!!!"
Goosebumps all the way till the end. This is mental.
а кто наши ?)
i suddenly feel bad for somnus
НАВИ ДАВИ !!!)))
"https://youtu.be/Bv4CqIxqTMA?t=3111

JerAx with the series winning call...""MAN UP....FUCKING MAN UP!"""
35:59 pl look like a king in that scene... So scarry
valve should invest more in dota2 so much needs to be updated so many heroes left without skin or taunt or other shit
"I gotta give mad props to Valve/the Dota 2 team.  Besides a brief shot of their logo at the beginning, the entire documentary is about the teams and the players, and not about Valve.  They do a good job at pushing the players as the stars, and not the game itself."
52:51 fuckin epic
Man chinese players talk so much shit to their opponents when they're in the room. OG just busy focused on their own playstyle.
"Topson, I am proud of you kid!"
So what exactly did ppasarel in TI8? Just give a massage to Notail? cause there's no other shot of him saying any revelant in the 5 games.
Go bigdaddy
"19:39
Ce6: yeaa
Notail: Chen PL? 
Ana: yeaa
All: Yeea"
"""Go home OG"" ? some serious sportsmanship right there!"
Go home OG?Hello VP!
the silent. . . ! in the backstage. .  when lose final remember me when i watch newbe.
"7ckingmad commentary every time he kills someone : ""Va niquer ta sale pute de mère""

I was laughing every time the camera was on him."
this is beautiful. the ending is beautiful. this clearly shows Positivity vs negativity. no doubt
That brought me back to summer18.....best ti in history
"Simply, it's a Masterpiece!"
Who wants OG vs EG true sight? 😂
"The most value about this story is ""DON'T BE ARROGANT BEFORE YOU CAN DESTROY THE ANCIENT"""
EPIC !
man this should be on Netflix
ceb is the one
GG fyy god
LoL can't do this because it's always Asian teams that win. There would be something similar if FNC won but again a Chinese team sweep them and that's just embarrassing
All LGD needed was a Ceb
Ana looks like he hates life
awesome man impressive
Это.Просто.Нечто.
"what I have learned in this vid is:

Difficulty level
Easy
Normal
Hard
God mode
Asian
European"
"58:48 my boy got airpods in, he didn't even need the money from winning. he already had it"
where’s the echo slam dodge 😥
"PSG play so well, and OG tenacity to hold on and bring the series to game 5, the comebackk. 
dont care who wins, i root for both of them, they play beautiful dota"
Spanish?
Себ просто тащил моральку команды в соло. истинный победитель
"7ckingmad is OG brain, dat guy is ultrasmart."
7ckingmad's axe saved them i love og god damn
Looks like one of those movies....but  it is not!!!!! It is real. Wow! Attitude wins..
"They dare to pick Axe in front of the tusk king?  
Yes sir, they dare indeed"
"после этого фильма возненавидел себа, видет  себя как маленький ребенок, говорит он, а стыдно мне. молодцы псж все спокойны и ведут себя по взрослы и адекватно начал их уважать."
Такие видосы сильно мотивируют
37:00 music?
"I prefer the cgi not to be overdone like that, it's too cheesy. Instead they should really done something like dota watafak did in their videos, use the actual clip from the match but from a zoomed in perspective."
wow just like the manga
jerax with his godlike posture
OG=Anime protagonist
Unban élite wolves :(
Only video I want to watch on the telly but it refused to go full screen. Bloody masterpiece.
"14:46 sinister pick of Kunkka and easy roll over then in game, masterpiece by Somnus"
"Damn. I want to forget this TI and watch it all of OG's games up to the very end. This is, indeed, the best TI ever."

"""Manila  Major 2016"" <3"

no entiendo nada peor oyis o yios xd
"The best TI i ever seen.
And the best true sight."
Somnus:Fy Save save save save nice
Man you could just tell notail wanted to win this so bad. They had fun doing it. I remember when he started in fnatic and he was just a jokester but he fucking did it and I'm so happy for him. I cried. I can't believe he didnt
PPasarel :)))) best mustache
I Need an IMAX for this! Especially the Cinematic!
thats so fucking crazy
40:40
Holy crap Ceb is holding a bunch of papers ! hahaahaa
OG deserved this much more than lgd.
BEST TI OF ALL
"I can't belive you did not add spanish subtitles knowing you have such a big latin american community 
This truesight is so good and i can't talk about it with my friends... that really sucks"

Who is here before 1 million views ?
"Dude, that ending was so amazing"

We all need atleast 1 ceb in our life.
2:46 LOL
"How to win Ti:
1) Teams up with Fly
2) Leave Fly
3) Win Ti next year

Proof: Miracle-, OG"
17:42 notail thug life
How can they not show the fight after 53:45?!
"58:37 ""Alin, du-te si tu cu ei, du-te cu ei."" :)"
Need one more true sight about upper bracket final game 3. How was the og s reactions :)
"I wish that they talked about the road OG had leading up to the TI, because the drama was insane with OG vs EG"
Nice “GO HOME OG” chant from the Chinese 😂 😆 🤣
"Как же это круто, жаль что вольво убивают Доту(((("
They trust each other. Win together or lose tonight! It is Dota!
Literally crying rn
"A very aptly named series ... 'True Sight'. This really does give us unbelievable insight into the journey of professional teams in pressure situations. As fans, watching only the games, we feel that what happens in the game is all that matters. Here we find out that what we see is less than half of the full story. I wasn't rooting for them, but I honestly believe that there couldn't have been a better winner's tale than OG at TI8."
Didnt know i was watching for an hour. This should be on cinemas
fucking flowers man 🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼
Русские есть?
"На 5 катке когда было 15 4 48:24  ог уже на такой минус морали были жеской пол тимы думало уже шо всё гг , только Себ такую +мораль давал на всю команду и не только в 5 катке между перерывами тоже, моё уважение, а китайцы тупо как машины че то сидят 0 эмоций при игре , рад за победу ОГ"
"Im just in tears right now... been playing dota since late 2013 with many breaks watching all TIs... but this movie, music, ODPixel commentary, the edit and overall whole piece together just gave me so much emotions. Now let someone say that e-sport and gaming is just dumb playing on PC! Love you n0tail well deserved after all these years and obstacles! Ceb youre great captain no matter of trashtalking in pubs! Jerax and Topson Finnish pride! Topson been playing dota for quite few years but serious dota he played 1 year and climbed top mmrs and without a earlier tournament expirience he managed to win the TI! Jerax outstanding clamness and feel of the game! Anathan (Ana) young talent just like wonderchild! Love You guys! Well deserved! GG!"
Hola dota 2!!
What was going on at 18:15?  FY getting patted down and Somnus taking some questionable stuff out of a random bottle? What was inside that?
That ending scene from NoTail! Goosebumps are real!
"I hope, guys, you have friends who share this video and enjoy it together. I haven´t. Not this kind of friends."
lo mejor q vi
"*After watching this I realized Ana and Topson were not the key player, It was Ceb, his leadership and positivity is so fucking admirable,  with great support of Notail, and careful supporting of Jerax. They won Ti*"
"Видео очень мотивирует, в конце чуть не всплакнул, Notail пройдя такой сложный путь выигрывает инт, ну просто нереальная самоотдача, браво"
"""I mean, I don't even know what the fuck's going on. I can't even see my own hero."" - Ana

Hahahahahahaha..."
35:58 that shit gave me chills
"Dude... like, what were the odds...
PSG LGD were so dominant throughout the whole event, they were the likely winners.
I couldn't believe they won. I was like ""How did they win?"" for a good 3-4 hours after the fact."
"wait, is N0tail russian?, french?, american?, wtf?"
just think positive :D
This literally gave me chills like the day they won the TI
Where aru u on that scenes? :3
38:50 amazing
Это бесподобно. Офигел от синематиков. Весь путь ОГ до инта и на самом турике достоин экранизации. История каждого из игроков мотивирует и вдохновляет.
"*NoTail proving us time and time again: ""Everything can work.""*"
"Brilliant, absolute masterpiece. Never ever in my life, have I been so pleased to hear someone speak French before."
Watching game 4 still makes me nervous for OG even though i already know they won lol
Pause at 52:14 guys. 😂😂😂
"Absolutely amazing work on this doco Valve. 

I can't help but feel this echos the differences between the east and the west when looking  at approaches to problem solving, eSports and life in general.

The Chinese had a team of mechanically gifted players who had a great understanding of the patch at the time and had momentum coming into TI8. They relied heavily on a structured play style and applied conventional thinking/understanding to the game.

LGD were outperforming every team until  they met a team who were equally gifted in mechanics, but came into the finals utilising analytics  (LGD were concerned with Cebs stack of papers) and statistics and thought outside the circle. They played and picked heroes that are deemed unconventional in the patch, completely throwing LGD off (ember, Zeus picks).  

OG even with everything on the line stressed having fun, doing different things and putting the team first as their priority and they shined when under pressure. 

Despite being an EG fan and all the drama that lead up to the tournament I can't help but be happy for this team. 

Before anyone cries racism I'm Chinese btw."
N0tail swearing in french :D
I just love the defeated look on the chinese faces.
"It would be absurd to write a script with such a storyline.
Also, the team working on the documentary did a spectacular job. Truly a masterpiece."
"Как будто заново посмотрел TI8, те же эмоции и теплота глубоко в душе :3"
"Omg I'm literally crying bruh. Never been so proud by playing this game. I still remember this final. It was phenomenal. I love this TI, for me it's the best TI ever. BigDaddy prove that he is a legend. There's so many legends in this game, Notail, Dendi, Puppey, Kuro, etc and I'm glad they still passionate in this game. 


#SendFlowersToN0tail"
"Ceb  просто душа команды , как же он поддерживал и материвал до конца! Только вот fy жалко , он был достоин больше всех в команде ЛГД"

What a fantastic music used at this video . Does someone know names of compositions ?
"Ceb the oracle. 25:03 ""We win the next one, and the one after"" 28:00 Ceb Axe ""You're gonna see some shit"""
That was one of the best things ive ever watched. Fuk me dead
bueno en la segunda partida le aposte a LGD y pues me hicieron ganar bastante dinero :D
"Да я бл так даже над хатико не плакал. Мэд, нутейл просто е*аные демоны. Эмоции на высоте. Как он их мотивировал. Просто нет слов. Хлопаю стоя. Пойду найду салфетки.."
"Хоть это и не СНГ состав, но я почему-то так рад за OG, а именно за Нутэйла. Он заслужил такой исход финала. Но все же жду такого же разгрома от наших медведей на TI19."
"The movie is great, but it is obvious that the editing is somehow unfair, just like Kiev Major. I've seen VP and LGD cheering for their team, I've also seen some positive attitudes from these two teams. This new True Sight and Kiev's one only shows people full of negative attitude. I don't think a finalist team would be like this all the time. By the way, I'm not salty, OG deserve this TI. I just hope valve can be more objective."
CHINA FANGAYS OMEGALUL!!!!!
best TI8 ever!!!
The Chinese team was tilted even before the start of the game.
i dont know why iam crying at late game (GAME 5)that moment
"Lgs player are so cold and unfriendly! I dont know if it is Chineese mentality or what but i think thats why they lost! Friendship and nice atmosphere pushed og further, ceb expecially, in therms of mental game!"
GUYS the cycle isn't broken yet. Ana is CHINESE.
How many money they can take???
Its the end statement thoooo
ana went into GODLiKE mode even fy was speechless...
10:47
"they all confuse on OG's pickings, they cant read them cost them a lot"
"topson, 100% TI winrate"
"I love bone7, where is he? no bone 7, no funny dota"
THEY FUCKIN DESERVE IT !
in the head after watching only «wow»
N0tail best waifu
"Если бы KBU попали бы на инт, всем была бы пизда."
ANA dont feel pressure be like ANA
"LGD are the real winners on TI8 the last game was stollen from them, everyone who watched the full matches know what I am talking about"
"awesome movie! i thought the close ups on the team fights were a little corny at first but they were really well done and added so much intensity to the over all feel of the vid! Happy I stuck around and watched the whole thing, makes me want to start playing dota 2 again :D"
"38:48 OMGGGGG SO MUCH HYPEEEEEEEEEEE, CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBBBBBBB"
Best documentary I have ever seen
36:42 when PL dispel invoker linkens with null when they obviously teammate =)) feelsweirdman
Damn og is the best always positive. No blaming just play the game and have fun !
"The spams from OG. I could literally hear ""LADAK MATATAG"" in each games 😂😂, No wonder LGD wanted to mute them. Rofl"
"55:30 Come on, Ceb! It's REAL!"
Ceb mental game is so fucking amazing
У ог тренер похож на мереану мордегард

Great game !

Subtitles in Spanish pls
Это просто невероятно. Отлично переданы эмоции и накал страстей после счета 2:1)

Best line to end it. Great job!
I am lost for words! Thanks you Valve - OG and LGD for an amazing show!
On est sur les nerfs!!!
Still waiting for the baby roshan

these animation clips really awesome..

Watching FY with the fireworks in the background without sound was heartbreaking :(
"Is the chinese translation good? Can anyone confirm?
I don't understand why they call spectre any other thing (subs were spectre and they never pronounced nothing even close to this). Same as phoenix, they call it something else. 
I wish they had a TRUE SIGHT more focused on the chinese team. I always get the feeling that they are being impartial."
38:40 best moment for Ceb
"Johan Prophet, anybody?"
это лучшее что я видел
"Chinese every where around the world, they think can take down OG by yelling ""go home OG"". dude, they go home with the AEGIS in his hand. You guys should go home to your land. just kidding LMAO"
Ceb is fucking mad and a real captain indeed!
FUCKING HYPE.
Честно я болел за lgd им чуть не хватило для победы
"Best True Sight, Best TI and the BEST TEAM OG. BEST FINAL OF TI."
"Congratulations! OG earned its respect and champion.
By the way, Fy deserved everything. :("
"52:08
*team was arguing*
Ceb - Guys, win or lose, we don't care, we play!

congratulations OG, you deserved
Ceb MVP"
05:30 Wait..... was that shoulders bump reference?
who is this man on 59:33?
Ceb
"46:29 notail ""were ready guys, were ready for a long time ""    damn its like they were waiting for these moments thier whole life !"
Unban prosor
"JeraX: 'Ana you want to reload into the base? Memes?'
Ana: 'Fuck off'

Have to love the humour in the most serious and vital situation in the final in game 4 ... wtf JeraX"
"38:48 DOTA-gasm
31:01 So THAT's what NoTail was yelling, lol."
How about that jinx?
о эти переходы от ликующих OG к подавленным LGD в конце
This is why we play
"Second time, when i cry about dota
First one was, when i was watching same ti live"
7:24 What is the background song name? Can someone help me?
I cried !!!!!! Dont know why?
"38:49 Animation shows that Axe taunted brew, morph and Tusk but in the live gameplay Ceb Axe taunted brew and a morph as PL and tusk wasnt even attacked by ceb. And Blademail animation didnt even appear. my eyess ahhhh"
"Ana Is A Man.. He is the best.But I Jerex and Ceb is the key of this Ti8 for OG. Big Daddy is the ""BIG-DADDY"" Nothing to say about a Warrior like Him.Well played OG"
if you haven't cried watching this are you even okay?
19:41 when Ceb sync with Big Daddy is so lovely
Why no one pick me?
"Damn, let me grab some snacks. I already know this is going to be good"
"THIS IS KARMA FROM LGD FANS SAY ""OG GO BACK HOME""!"
"This guys are true team, Psg is too formal man, this guys had the right spirit, thats why they won"
The most incredible thing about TI is that the lineup doesnt matter. TI8 showed it.
I don't play nor watch Dota but holy shit this was a well done video to represent how good the game really plays out in such a cinematic event O.O
28:26 Bring Back OPEN AI :D
Guys how can I get the original music score? The sound supervising is fantastic in this true sight
Tracks please.. :)
We must be like Ceb! Just play and win. Nice team support
FY is the GOD of dota.
чето в глаз попало
28:07 ceb is bad ass
"im interested in some spanish subtitles, i can do it but i think that the video uploader ""dota2 official channel"" must give permissions to submit subtitles, i wish i could do it."
то ради чего стоит жить
"the pressure from LGD coach really make it bad to the players, they cant afford losing while OG players doesnt care anymore, staying chill for the rest of the game, doesnt matter losing or winning, they're still a family. Good fight, and such a mythbreaker TI."
I got an orgasm when Axe called in the 4th game. MAN!!!!!
Seeing the faces of LGD at the end oh my oh my HAHAHAHAHA LMAOOOOO
thanks GABEN for making this great video :)
"Это просто пиздец, я целый час глазом не моргнул"
i still cant believe it that og won ti. 3 months before ti they were playing like a tier 4 team. they won ti from the open qualifiers to the finals. what an amazing comeback! this has to be one of the best tis ever
FY.. F God.. This guy has my respect.. M truly an OG Fan
When is the directors cut released?
Merlini 😭😭😭
"That ""Go Home OG"" sounds outside make the OG's spirit are burned. U deserved that OG"
Okay iam crying.

"first kuro , now n0tail. damn"
"CEB просто сумасшедший чел, так настраивать всю команду на победу когда казалось бы такой напряг, такой минус мораль ( сам играю в доту уже не мало лет) Завидую его сдержанности , достойнейший чел, видео кайфовое"
55:36 *insert sad violin effect*
"My god, how the fuck they can predict each other? Is this what always happened in TI ? And LGD, they r just like a fucking robot. No emotion ouside when losing TI. If i were them, i would just stay silent and if someone talked to me, i would burst out crying. ""Losing at early is ok, but when you lose at the finals, its very hurt"", Dendi."
OH GEEEEEE!!!
Did Fly Watch this True Sight

"Go home lgd fans

"I watched all live and thought Topson was MVP, but no man Ceb is the reason they won TI8."
"All i want is to play dota , no matter what."
"Worst coach ever on LGD..fy should on draft, but sad to see ame,fy and xnova..just kick the fuck ass somnus from LGD..
1 Smoke for 1 break love that scene :)) whatever this is the best true sight ever"
*EZ OSCAR*
"Как же мне fy больше всех жалко, он реально заслуживает эту эгиду среди всех 10. Будем верить что в этом году Lgd точно заберут этот трофей, заслуживают, лучшие!!!"
I really need the names of all those soundtracks.
"Omg! This is why we fund the TI bois!
Great work, only thing that tops this was the real event!"
OG ❤️❤️❤️
Well I love this series cause Riot make so many quality content and all but valve can make something great too
"14:44 when lgd player ask somnus what u want to face their 2core
""Kunka"" make me fell weird"
Feel sorry for FY... But happy for Notail
"Рубик выйграл инт , хейтите дальше этого гера))0"
I need Ceb to motivate me to remove my stack of cloths off my gaming chair and finally fold them and put them in the closet.
IT'S FUCKING BEAUTIFUL.
i love topson<3
36:33 Did they shoot it from a Monitor or what..?
!arcana
"best ti ever,thx for emotions <3"
What a sick editing and documentary. Missed some of the best parts but doesn't matter. The emotional feeling of watching this video is real.
WTF ЧАС ПРОЛЕТЕЛ ЗА 1 МИГ ! an hour passed in one moment!
this really feels like some Hollywood shit...
Notail and Ceb are French?
crowd so rude . ' go home og '. WTF
its my favorite sport <3
"9:57, что нотейл крикнул?"
who says its just a game
"Valve piensa que solamente su gente es
-Chino
-Ruso e
-Inglés
No veo los subtitulos en español"
you got JINX 😂
I re-watched this just to see myself cheering for OG after they won game 4
"Ana is a fucking OpenAI man, he doesn't have an emotion. He just play his best and win. That's all"
"Wooooo

It was so fucking emotional!"
Мурашки
One of the best 1 hours i spent. Thanks Valve for this amazing aftermovie!
In a team.. You really need a supportive player like ceb.. He's very good to boost the moral support! 👍 Congrats again OG! You guys deserve it!
GIVE THE BOY INVOKER !!
WHERE YOUR CAO NI MA PI NOW LGD FAN GAYS? PLEASE CRY
Допизделись.
YEAH FUCK LGD FOR LOOKING DOWN ON PEOPLE ...FUCK YOU
GO HOME OG ? LMAO
55:36 fy had the same expression as kaka in ti7 grand final
music design level : hans zimmer
Where is ame?
Pepe hands
"i felt sorry for LGD's loss at first when i saw this video, but at second watching, i think they deserved it, with their disrespecting (like being toxic on Ceb for making notes on a paper) and proudness"
man i love ceb for his leadership also notail
"What if they call gg and we miss it?

I honestly lost it there"
when clash my heart beat so fast. wtf
"VOLVO WHERE"" S AME? PSG LGD PLAYED GRANDFINAL WITH 4 PLAYERS?
Upd: AHAHHAHAHH AME AT 51:51 guys :DDDDDDD"
"I actually feel bad for fy he was one of my fav player, but fuck them i hate the chinese team anyway specially ame what a fucking cocky kid. Lol jk.

i just think n0tail and ceb was deserve it even they was overachieved in this TI, they effort and sacrifice was something else, like man this OG was really build up again from the scratch after fly and s4 betray them, and did anyone know who topson before this event? Like fuck no maybe you see him sometimes in watch games but no dude before joining OG no one recognise him at all. And OG was a reallly super underdog come to this event and they winning it, this is the hell of amazing story from OG specially n0tail and Ce6"
Somnus > Topson #5game
"For the 330 LGD fans who dislike the video,grow up. Both sides gave it there all and I am sure LGD being a strong team will win coming TI."
"The ambient music in this true sight was great, anyone know if it's available elsewhere?"
EUROPE NUMBA WAN
"'Their play is messy they are all dumb asses'






Ends up losing the finals"
"Сука сделайте с переводом, почему в раше нткуя никто не додумался сделать такое так хочеться смотреть и вникать."
Chinese so cocky. Og just so humble. Thats why they are deserving.
Need to rewatch the ti8 finals boys !
Ceeeeeeebbbbbbbbb! I'll never forget 😁
"Look at the losers who lost due to his pride. do you want to smile again, china team?"
next level editing. i soo love the small things that adds into this video/movie
How is this appealing? Looks pretty dumb.
OG Powered by friendship!
"Fy - what if they call gg?
Notail - Hold my Ana"
OG has always had a true sight or a true sight movie... they had it!
i love you kaci! you're the best part of TI
7cking LEGENDS.
42:00 what is Song?
Anyone knows the name of the soundtrack from 41:45 - 43:17 ?
LGD was a Finalist .. OG is a Winner.
The most remarkable dota international tournament!..
"@9:26 :DD that face is magic! Great idea for a video series, just a snap shot for us pheasants into what it is like once in the booth! :)"
Щщс Это пиздец час контента
EG vs OG ?
"im liquid fans, but watching this game and see how cooperative this team makes me also enjoy the fight that og brought to the games
i think they have good capt, cooperation, and really2 high confident. 
i like this team."
35:07 ti winning moment
Notail - biggest boss
I was waiting for notail at the end of game 5 to say FUCK YOU EG.Fly
I like it
till 8th min i thought it was 4x5 because there was no Jerax lmao
"ну вот, опять в финале Fy ставят играть против 9, а он ещё и выигрывает 2 карты из трёх"
"ребята , я смотрел от начала до конца с субтитрами, я просто не могу представить какие эмоции получают игроки хотя бы играть при такой большой сцене и аудитории на стриме..

если я тут дома сижу и ахуеваю на столько, что кажется моментами что я играю в кабинке на финале ти8! 
Спасибо за такую красивую игру!
Очень многому учит этот финал... ( если  тут чуваки в пабе сдаются на 10 минуте) 
а тут парни которые бляяяяяяяяяяяяяять, просто сука собрали свои ебучки и сделали ГРАНДИОЗНУЮ ИСТОРИЮ! 
СПАСИБО!"
when u got a player/coach who supports you anytime CEB
Chainsmoking addicts
55:14 the moment notail knew they won
"i think I heard chalice cursing in every sentence , 

LOL 

CAONIMACAONIMACAONIMA"
Got me good😎
Sub indo ☹
55:13. Notail.......The face of pure emotion...This moment really got me right in the feels.
"Gilaaa ternyata ceb keren banget.  Ngangkat moral team terus.  Beda ama pelatih sebelah.  Jago nebak draft tapi ga bisa ngangkat mental team.  Topson di bully abis abisan mentalnya,  jerax yang selalu relax,  notail captain yang selalu percaya pilihan player dan ana manusia super jenius di dota 

Love OG.  Semoga cepet dapat carry yang bagus.  Amiin"
Give the boi invoker
Atleast they dont cry like newbee did hahahaa
"Got to 10 minutes and decided to save this to watch with my Dad later today. I really want to watch this for the first time with him. True Sight is really easy for older people to watch, because the actual gameplay is so secondary to the story, which is the opposite when watching the games. But the stories can be so compelling, especially this one."
"Бля, а то, шо это Интерстеллар?)"
"thank you for this wonderful film, valve."
"Talk more, but never underestimate your enemy"
"Legendary Ceb cursing and swearing, with n0tail screaming ""putain"" just because. Can't stop laughing :')"
This gave me the fucking feels at the last 15 seconds
LGD真的跳 稳赢的实力必输的心态 zzz
"PSG was too over-confident,maybe that's why they lost..."
28:16 when you talk so much LOL
"ооо Это амайзинг, жаль что нехуя не понятно, при том что ток снг катает в доту"
"теперь понятно почему у лгд не было и шанса, это видно по тому, что происходит в перерывах, их разница в поведении, когда лгд обсуждают стратегии и критикуют ошибки, ог просто поднимают мораль и командный дух"
the most deserved win in TI history
Good job good editing this video realy makes me so emotional... now i know how high the thinking level of pro players
"Well played OG , congratulations"
"Cinematic at 38:37 define OG as a team.. That's what real friends would do in real life!
Real winner was e-sports.. Loved the crowd!"
34:44 song pls
"Never forgive 
Never forget"
This is the best finals in dota 2 and one of the very best comeback in any professional tournament for any sports. Congrats OG.
"Valve, you made me cry! Starting and ending with that clip of n0tail and that background music throughout, i think many filmmakers can learn a thing or two from this master piece!"
Ceb is fucking great leader. Positive mentality. In OG they never blame each other
that was awesome
I`ve just seen anime about cybersport. This plot can`t be real)
"@42:38 ""You realize I hit 15000 hours in DotA during this finals? Whatever they have, I have more than them"""
Я готов слушать этого диктора вечно
goosebumps
19:38 best moment :)
"Thanks, Ceb."
"Mi papi notail y el mejor support del mundo Jerax, son lo máximo T_T"
This fucking grand finals is extraordinary. I mean i play csgo and i know how this game works but damn. Much respect to both teams for giving dota fans an unbelievable series!
cebbbbb...  really was a great final..
50:40 hit a like
Есть СНГ комьюнити?
The team spirits are soo different
That Ana TP GOD
"I remember that OG team won TI, it gives me even sadness..  They did not deserve it!!"
14:45.KUNKAAA
"Лучший TI, божественный трусайт"
they didn't show the euls dodge from echo by Ana Ember :(
I hope all of you guys are well :D
"Their expression showed it all. Every single momment, look at their emotion, its like we can feel their emotions too"
""
"LGD lack of happiness on playing. they are like looking for a price(i know every team looking for the price but remember: ""if you're not happy what you are doing, you will end up on failing."")"
Holy shit the BGM is almost hans zimmer tier
"EPIC, especially the interview of notail 2 years ago"
ахуел когда китайцы после потной вышли пыхнуть по сижке
My favourit movie..
"Johan might be the captain, but Ceb is the leader."
Guys look at 0:38 notail already give tips to lgd how to win tournament..haha
"Johan might be the Captain, but Ceb is the one who made a lemon into lemonade when life gives them a lemon."
"Kinda felt bad for fy. Really wanted him to win. He is a very talented player. Anyways, congrats to OG"
''One last ride..'' His last words in this video are so inspiring for me. Thank you so much OG for winning TI and proving that hard work and friendship really make dreams come true!
omg im cryin
http://makecashing.com/?userid=25564
Why is Ana not on the team anymore ? Why they treat Ana like that ? He said ceb carried so hard and Ana didn’t nothing ? I don’t know there was a home shade thrown on Ana ? Can anybody explain ? He felt left out
Notail smoking near no smoking sign..badass hahahaha
Охуенный финал 🤘👍
"those chinese guys only whining and blaming, that's why they lost - OG was a team."
notail predicted his future at 2016 now is been use for true sight. thank for ana and so he left dota 2 . 59:30
"29:14 29:40 and he's not talking shit, WP Ceb."
Jinx is real nyxxxx nyx nyx nyxx.
"37:28 -Jerax ""Ana wana relocate to thier base? memes""  Ana ""Fuck off"""
Fy : Tusk King Lmao
35:57 best fucking moment
No mention about the moment when Ana sold aquila and Talisman of evasion on PL for buyback and def the base ? Volvo sorry ?
MAKE IT AGAIN AT TI 9. ITS SO FUCKING AMAZING!!!
37:54 that's the pure spirit of doing something naughty and RUN from it
38:40 When your younger brother got bullied and beaten up- help big bro! Epic!
v\\\fuck that french guy
LGD was just too strong to lose. But they lost. Now i still can accept that result
"31:44
Notail : Bulldog !!"
fy god!!!
Notail... just want to play the best dota. OG!
56:56
52:14 is when you see a pussy for the first time
Who dislike this true sight? PSG.LGD fans?
Kunkaa
27:11 this ceb 😆. Great leadership. Take No Negativity. Ggwp. OG!
I dont even know why china team always play pressured and fucking serious and they lose just like ti7
38:49 CEEEEBBBBBBBBBBB!!!!
Шедевр...
I felt goosebumps after watching this. Does anyone too?
WP Ceb for the teamspirit
This is fcking awesome!
waiting ti9 true sight...
40:34 Thought i am sLEEPY
I am an OG Fan butI feel sad for FY.
56:56 BEST MOMENT EVER!!! I BELIEVE THAT I CAN ALSO RISE THE AEGIS OF IMMORTAL REMEMBER MY NICKNAME TIKA +
This shit was the thing thing ive watched in so long.
40:26 that the secret
"The game 4 was really a game changing moment to both teams. It had a positive impact on OG and a negative impact on PSG.LGD. OG gained back their self-esteem and confidence in winning the game. Meanwhile, PSG.LGD crumbled in fear and was expecting they could sweep them by game 4. Their mental fortitude started to crack down at the picking stage. You can see it in their faces especially Somnus that they were all revered up and got too focused on the main goal which is winning not the moment that they played the game."
I wait a long time for this
YES YES YES
WHY DISLIKES ?
"god damn it , this editing .. you gotta love it !"
"OG TI8 champs
Most chatwheel used in TI
Lakaaad matatag!! Normalin normalin.."
"wnt IIte-ms d0-ta 2 ?
Come and see me"
I miss ana
"True Sight : OG vs EG TI8
Please?"
I need bluray edition of this
27:17 give boy the toy
37:27 meme is life
"I know how it ended, but I was still worried about OG"
https://youtu.be/Bv4CqIxqTMA?t=3566s <3 <3 <3
It all in their mind. They took out all the negatives and pour their minds with positivity. Who the hell thinks that way down 2-1 HAHA. Man this is the best TI!
The discipline of chinese dota is unbelivable!!
"The Chinese are so analytical and og is just chilling and playing,"
31:03 Jerax started laughing when ceb and notail started speaking french. lmao.
OG OG OG OG !! N0T41L !
"Emotional rollercoaster. Again.
It was like for the first time - when i wasn't sleeping whole night, shouting, laughing and crying during all the five games. I wanted them to win this TI. I watched every game. And I was so happy when they finally took that aegis.
They really deserved this 🌻"
Soundtrack at 49:05?
gotta be admit that this was the best TI
Notail should shave that stache now.
"Now I finally understand.
Ceb = The real MVP! What an awesome leader he was in this TI!"
That Ceb's call's cinematic reproduction....chills....
9:24 OPPA OPPA BOIS
That rubick's fissure in game 5 was so underrated. That was a doom for LGD
Ana's girlfriend is really cute
ceb looks like harry poter
Go Home OG????? =))))))
i really wanted a true sight of og vs eg
"That editing skills, amazing"
like si puedes leer esto :'v
31:05 i know why jerax i laughing xD
318 chineses disliked
so much feeling ... og go og go og go
Ухх
"crow: {go home og}
crow : ......"
"37:02

Jerax: Ana wanna relo into the base?
Ana: No, no
Jerax: Memes?
Ana: Fuck off haha
Jerax: Byebye"
good film
"Idk but i just not look og as a team but its like a family dude, they are calm but so fvking strong and solid. They 100% deserve it 👏."
20:15 Cao ni ma is real😂
"Ana : ""Do you think Ember's still good ?"""
Лайкай если ты руссий и пришёл посмотреть на мусоров на ИТ.
"im crying :""("
The team that deserved it the most won... i´m happy
I like how Ceb's motivated his team just like giving them confidence to win. Well played!
"LGD Coach lacks some motivation skills for his players... 
anyone noticed?"
5:42 next level play
CEEEEEEEEEEEBBBBBB
"I Love OG so much, the trust, how they motivate each other even in that situation thats why they keep coming back. and LGD really is a fucking strong team damn. Their confidence tho."
"TI7 Underwater theme = Liquid
TI8 Emerald theme = OG

Coincidence?"
Notail really deserves this. Real fighter.
34:06 Go Home OG?? smh xd
Как же хорошо быть в топе.
The best karma ive ever seen in my whole damn life. Happy that OG and its fans doesnt have an awful attitude like this chinese people inside that arena has.
Is this a smoking ad?
Ana so fucking serious in face
tmr ahora como chucha lo miro en mi c rro no enseñan ingles
"41:49 
what are your plans this summer?"
"fuck who think that invoker is so pro, he just carried by ana"
GO HOME LGD
notail too cute to smoke
The best thing they did in the video is that Dota heroes come to live and it looks like a cool movie or something
Damn the chills watching this
22:07
Good shit OG good shit
PogU
I like ceb .. he is cheer up teammate
Ceb is so calm and motivating....
"Ceb mentality - Everything is fine, just enjoy the game. The real PMA!"
man i have some question  that Ana he has any felling? lul Kappa
That last clip got me chills.
OG交流的比较多，善于抓住LGD的弱点以痛击，LGD交流的都是对于对方的不屑，骄傲的代价呀，第四局LGD BP迷茫了，错失了夺冠良机，第五局的LGD在前期巨大优势下被翻盘，LGD的毛病在TI下暴露无疑，但是这俩支战队我都喜欢呀。。。
"Ame : where i’m 
Gaben : u got 3 sec for this 51:45"

Kamukha ni ana si cer. Mike hahah
"Topson never played any camp in his life, the first one was the most important of all, and he won, i mean, there's no such a thing as impossible in life lul"
That was cool
"i crie, but feels good man"
"The best shit on youtube, belive me"
Rip fy he looked so sad sitting there after game 5
It was the best true sight ive ever seen in my life omg hardwork pays off one day
Only 291 chinese ppl saw this?
WHERES THE EULS DODGE!!!!
"a humble team, well played team og, congratulations"
gO hoMe oG
55:37 Vietnam flashbacks
<3 thank you valve <3
It's amazing ... the players are awesome. The better play (comeback) is ana with pl
"Норм, но Киев Мажор ни что не переплюнет."
"BibleTrump

"Props to somnus, he back's up his talks with some ridiculous plays. ! ! The best BO5 in history"
When u realize that Ceb is a playing-coach... 😁
"Ti7 : Liquid 
Ti8 : Axe * Ember"
"""PUTAAAIN"""
302 people playing mobile legends thought its better than dota 2 so they hit dislike.
"25:17 "" if we win next game, remember to take off your jacket""
Legend says they still wear those jacket up till today :3"
Thanks god that i was borned in right generation
"THAT THE WAY UH HUH UH HUH!
I LIKE IT UH HUH HUH!
BEST TRUESIGHT EVERRRRR
STAY POSITIVE EVEN THOUGH EG BROKE THIER ROSTER😢
#OGFOREVER!!!
I ALSO WANT TO BRING BACK THE OLD GANG😭😭"
Amazing
"I have no beef against Chinese teams, they're insanely good, in fact, they're probably the ones producing MANY talents in the scene but some don't get recognized like some EU/West players(cos of memes), but jeez man, this shows how they just 'incorporated' DotA. While here we have OG, a life-turning $11m on the line, treating DotA a game where you enjoy like it's supposed to be."
"there are very few things stronger than a true friendship, sadly fly realized it when it was too late....congratz OG and kudos to FY, the only CN player i respect"
"I don't know why Chinese ppl so cocky, I guess this is the reason why they lose LMAO I was so happy seeing this bunch of dickhead losing XD XD"
Ceb: win or lose we don't care we're playing 52:09
What a leadership Ceb!!
AME MUTED ?? ahaha
Прослезился!
58:47 Chalice rocking the pods before they were cool
"вообще не показали решающие моменты в игре и что в этот момент говорили обе команды, странно ваще, было в 3 играх 3 супер момета и только 1 показали и то чуть чуть!"
"ana be like..i dunno what the fuck is going on , i cant even see my hero...man i lost my shit there"
What a coach!! Good vibes in there for team OG 👏👏👏
"49:47
For a sec they forgot that they in ti finals"
"You the man, CEB! 🔥🔥🔥"
I kinda wanna see OG in every Truesight video. So much emotions behind the scenes.
"The way Somnus said ""Kunnka"" at 14:47 with pure confidence scared me.The Somnus zone bois."
9:25 ultimate surprised pikachu face
man this is way better than harry potter series!!!
The animation at 36:30 is superb
"Fy: Tusk king right here !
Ceb: Tusk who?"
"12:25

"This is truly epic, thank you for this video. Truly appreciate the cameraman, the editing, highest respect to the team who did this. You truly love dota and it shows. This video looked like a movie and i cried watching this.

Spectacular Dota performance for both teams, much respect."

CEB is great.. he is a good leader..
38:40 epic
very good true sight...omg
"i feel like if OG lost TI8, they'd still celebrate"
OG mind set is the reason of being TI 8 winner .
Снято офигенно. Очень круто передана атмосфера. Аж мурашки по кож. Бтв Вилат в телевизоре)

"Such a great movie even from the begining -> wanted to press Like
One sided.(Showing OG from their best side while showing Chinese guys like ""ehhh"") ->Wanted to press Dislike.

But IMO you shouldn't idolize one team while show the weak sides of another"
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB
lgd talking shit to Og and now they look like shit!
Go Home OG what? All that confidence wiped out of their faces. Oh... I love seeing Chinese tears especially Somnus'. Hahaaa.
Ceb's Words of wisdom help alooooot!
CEB is da real MP
i don't particularly like Notail but in here he looks dope and  he fckin' deserves that win
LGD was just like the Newbee at Ti7.

Ana not replying.Lulz
55:13 is so pure
I love you boys <3
"10 out of 10. This is a fucking scene, this is a fucking fucking good series. Proud of them at the grand finals. Hope that 2019 will be another grand fucking finals. How many ""fucking"" did I say in this comment though *lol"
Как же это ахуенно!!!
dang! OG! feels train! T.T Lakad Matatag! Normalin! Normalin!
Ceb is everything for OG
"what an amazing production/editing. From the filming the players, animation, DoTA is just in another level."
Mute them xd
"I just think that I can feel their emotion..
Oh Mann I lose my shit"
hearts pounding for 1 hr. woooh! . hahaha.. gratss..
nooob CHINESE SMALL DICK
"why camera never shot ame, i mean like focus shooting ame? or ame never talking in this video?"
"the presentations are so good...
thanks for the good work valve team, u gave us what we trully want to know"
PSG LGD fans give that True Side dislike )
nice editing ...
Does anyone else think that Sommus was like the perfect villain . Fitted the role perfectly. The best true sight ever. Everything about it was great . From editing to emotions to gameplay
"Сильные OG) Скоро в нашем СНГ , появятся новые OG)"
Thank you volvo for making this video. this was an experience.
18:16 What pills is somnus taking?
those animation tho
Better than bird box
Мечтаю увидеть Virtus Pro на их месте на TI9...
"Btw, that OG.Ana's poker face is awesome:D"
35:56 a legend was born......
"49:47
they losing at the time...
BUT THEY STILL MAKING JOKE AND LAUGHING






the real legend is here"
EPIC
CEB is the best playmaker...
Everything can work
"go home OG? well, you go home first LGD"
Cebz & Ana MVP
Topson is so fucking trash! He just got carried bye Ana and Ceb
i fuken cry watch this shit
"Editing: 10/10
QUALITY CONTENT!!!"
urgh my eyes... this damm unions
"if you want to win a TI, Steal that paper"
"Yung taga ""yo yo"" ka lang @topson"
"true sight получился отличным, но смотреть его в отрыве от всего турнира сложно, т.к не все зрители смогут понять насколько psg.lgd были сильны на протяжении турнира и насколько невероятными казались победы og"
"2:16 its like topson first tournament he got nothing before,and then he win Ti😂"
If you want to watch the whole PL 25 moment go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qls04-4CF0k at 1:07:30
"это было еще в августе,а у меня до сих пор мурашки от этой гребанной серии карт,ради таких моментов стоит играть в Dota2.i want to play,play,play,play dota P.S Ceb.."
"39:18   I can't even seee my hero
  That Ana"
"Mad respect to Ceb, he's fucking mad. I'm pretty sure, when his career in Dota is over, he'll still be relevant. This kind of guy, wherever he goes, succes follows him"
"Funny how in same lime light one team celebrates and another mourns their defeat. This is life Man. CEB is what we need to be for our own life. GGWP OG, GGWP"
"In the last game it was interesting to see how western players are more extrovert and positive compared to asian counterparts. LGD was rather dark, pessimistic, depressive whereas OG was positive, encouraging, etc. I think this is why at the end, being optimistic and positive helps you be creative and succeed more in life..."
The only advantage of OG is that they have Ceb. That man is what every team needed. Hahahahahaa
"Somehow, the cinematography make OG look like a group of friends while PSG.LGD like a corporation."
"Ah ,man the feels hits your right in the gut"
"22:22. Wait a minute. Lina scared of fire, really ???"
CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB
39:48 we do notail we do <3
did anyone get goosebumps on Ceb Axe call? or is it just me lmao/
LGD talk to much when lose silence 😂
"big ups for valve, for documenting this, fuckin beautiful! brilliant!"
"LGD picks the best heroes for the game, OG picks their best heroes"
"be aware guys in TI 9 another team will pop up with some unknown ppl and amaze us 
that's how TI works.."
congrats bois
Should make true sight for OG game vs EG
The guy who present the match has so much passion for this game! I loved it.
"watching this for the second time,still give me goosebumps"
'PUPPEY' spotted at 2:16 . How many of you noticed?
team win game 1 lose final? who is ti7 winner then
ONE LAST RIDE JOHAN!!!
a good guide for professional trash talking
Just fight nothing to lose enjoy the game
"We are gonna slay,slay,slay and slay - Ceb 2k18"
28:00 : ceb: “yeah this might be the axe game”. Hell yeah he’s really carrying the game with his axe
The most epic grand finals in the history of e-sports to date.
"The way Somnus said ""Kunkka"". That confidence 14:46"
Still hard to believe that this is the first tournament lan game for topson and first tournament game in a while for ana. They fcking deserved this
"That's what you get when you're so full of yourself. Lmao 😂 

Btw, n0tail's laughs are so precious.. 😍"
TI IN MANILA SOUNDS GREAT.
Lol ceb holding a lot of papers
Lgd sure about win the ti because pattern but over confident never end good ~~
AME muted for 50 mins
"Was that the ""Hans Zimmer - Cornfield Chase"", bgm of Interstellar at 42:17 o.O"
The pleasure of seeing sad cocky fuckers losing
It was over when Ceb started swearing on French
"38:45 ""Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb"""
ahh sad chinese faces.... fucking nice
wkl
Good editing sequence and the highlights all the feelings towards both teams. The legends OG working as a team from open qualifiers to champions. GGWP 2018 for ANA and CEB.
"Lol shaker banned in game 4, tuskar king my ass bwahahahahaha"
Thank you! Amazing works.
Lgd just trash talks while og played like a team and don't blame any misplays or anyone... Those are competitors that is worth of every ounce of respect
27:00 Franklin Lancer bois
Wasup EG?
the most humble team i've ever seen....team OG is one of the best team that i'm looking forward to...well play OG thumbs up!!!
OG doesnt deserve TI
55:38 when its new year but you’re in game
"After game 4 , both teams had a different mentality 


Whoever wins the mental game wins the game"
"""Johan, we won TI""
Johan: ""hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahha"" :D:D"
I FUCKING LOVE THIS GAME
"Ame words - 0, Ana - 5(?) silend boys"
Wp
Валв спасибо💜💜💜
"Game 5 theres alot of great plays and its a bit disappointing that you didnt feature the echo dodge by ana 




Still dope true sight tho"
Where is the echo dodge :(((
to win ti eat lots of banana.
Where's the savior of OG?!
"This is an hour long video, amazing didn't get bored"
Who wants to see EternalEnvy winning the Aegies of Immortal?
The Goosebumpsss !!
"I love how calm OG are. Ceb always chill them up everytime they lose fight. Keep believe in ana and comeback after having a very bad early game. Unlike LGD, their coach always blame blame and blame."
"""Go home OG,"" the chinese crowd cheered. Fucking cunts. Cried at the end omegalul"
Блять никто из команды LGD не пытаются подбодрить друг друга! Даже после луза блять можно же сказать что то чтоб мораль так не упал!
FY's face looks like he is really Pissed Off on what just happened on the last game he should join a non chinese team if he wants to win TI
54:45 when happiness turns into sadness
"Hmmm, no China win every time they're making True Sight"
i wonder how EG.FLY feels about this .. LOL
OG is the spirit of Dota teamwork
11:31 is that w332
55:36 твой пукан когда проиграл на Грандфинале TI
"In this tournament fy showed us how scary a ""support"" could've become, also xNova with his warding, most people wouldn't notice it but it's top notch
I rooted for both team"
Its a fucking valve movie and only have 3 subtitles lol
39:11 Ana and its best
that banana is one of the reasons why OG won TI8 😂
Now this is what Dota is about.
lgd just dug their own grave by banning centaur on game 4 lmao
Notail smoking at No Smoking zone
That game-losing buyback damnnnn so damn close
"Just my opinion. TI9 is gonna be bad. Why? Because ""GO HOME OG"". Disrespecting."
"Спасибо Valve, что не забыли про ру-комьюнити, всего 3 субтитров, и одни из них русские."
"I hope fucking FLY is watching this and reading this comment, in your face you little snake!"
"We can see a lot of positivity in OG's booth, even in toughest moments when LGD was a little too intense and stressful. In a game that everything can turn a round in some minutes, staying positive is really important. And 7ckingmad is a really awesome leader."
I like how ceb stay positive even they are losing. Keep it up!
"Wait is this years True Sight only about the final??

Pls tell me there is a version about the whole TI, this gotta be a joke!"
Its so satisfying to see China Crowd with the sad faces this payback for Team Liquid ty for breaking the TI Curse OG Good Job 💪💪💪💪💪
19:08 - Нужно выбирать первыми лысик)) чёт в голос
39:16 - Me after losing every fight
ur pride let u down LDG Nothing magic happened in Game 3 #wpOG
2:48 ana switch to a new tab. Must be watching porn 😂
"Fy : Fucking hell,
they dare to pick axe in front of the tusk king? That's pretty savage"
Notail and FY the smoke God. Each and every after the game they are going for the smoke break. Hahaha
sadly lgd got no coach mentality like ceb thats how og win this pep talk by ceb
Somnus losts game 5 alone with his rubbish items
55:36 poor FY All the emotion i know that feel when my team losse at final lan online tournament and its our team first journey:)
On est sur les nerfs...
See how composed OG are even though they're losing while on the other hand LGD are just sighs and pure quiet.
"Chinese : GO HOME OG GO HOME OG GO HOME OG







OG Go Home With the Aegis lmao"
11/10
Biji wkwk
Oh yeah
"17:42 notail smoking next to a ""no smoking sign"" :)"
Wp ceb. What a good leadership
Ceb strategy spectre+ana=win ti8.
Block the User !!
"This should be on cinema, MASTERPIECE DOCUMENTARY DUDEEEEEEEEEE"
The best TI so far after TI 3
55:38 give me one word to describe what he feels
im fking crying.. this is so amazing fuckkkk.
Is it true that China banned miracle from attending the next major because poland arrested that Huawei spy (China spy).
BoomID needs a true sight. Kappa
"I’m fucking a little bit emotional. NoTail, you’re not only good support but fucking supportive to your fucking team too. OG deserve to win. They played well, enjoy every single match they have played and no fucking blame each others. I do inspired NoTail since I watch True Sight episode OG vs Vp. GGWP! 

Sincerly, 
Team Secret’s fan"
Everyone is opening their mouths watching on the monitor😂 52:12
"We won together
We lose together
We slay together
We slay together 
We slay togethet

-Ceb"
Просто по человечески рад за ребят они достойны!
Would be ashamed ... Look at the clip RISE. That's how you have to show the winners.

"Notail : Nice! Nice! (Shouting)
Ceb : my ears
Notail : *laughing

#gold"
@Ceb D: tf
"They have a really big problem. Pl lvl25 guys 


*goosebumps*"
55:12 it dawned on notail that he was going to win TI. What an epic expression
People says video game destroys a person. well heck yeah look at those LGD faces
Fucc Ana is fcking cool until the end he's quiet haha haha BIG CLAP FOR CEBBBBBBBB!
It looks like I'm watching an anime and give me the chills because there's  no extreme BS comrade powers.
"Really wanna see Ana's eul dodge in this video...
But it doesn't matter, 1 hour True Sight is still the best!!!"
Bors
Hit Like id ana is the best
Ceb the true leadership! The motivator . Hats off
When you see half of the dialogues are spoken by ceb
No Echo Slam Dodge by Ana ?
All dota players must watch it.
17:40 you see notail smoking in a no smokinh area 😂
"Wait, what if they call GG and we miss it? 5;53 - you said what? hahahahhahaha you lose you missed saying GG hahahah damn LGD hahahha"
Don't worry Chinese ppl...you still have our Spratlys ^_^...you show dominance so bad hehehehehe
*QUEM SEMPRE ACREDITOU DIGITA: 199*
Too cinematic and scary Somnus 14:42 - 14:48
GIVE THE BOY INVOKER!
I love the pep talks by Ceb. damn!
"Production Value POG
*gives Gaben a pat in the back*"
that optimism by n0tail... damn!
36:15 the tornado had a HP bar so freakin funny xD
wp boyss🔥🔥
Its worth the wait.
Ceb is so postive!
The best True Sight..
somnus r shit
"this is why i like team OG....they dont even tilting each other even they lose some clashes..their players was really calmed,especially Notail who gives them moral support and motivation..big respect OG"
This proved to me that LGD is a group of fucktards who always assumes that they are the strongest team in the major like their chinese kin in the audience. Always belittling OG which made them blind of possibilties of comeback and lose in the process.
The chills
ti7 just less than 30 mins. Ez for Liquid
this crazy
TI8 Final : Who gets Earthshaker who win. (Unless you got Rubish to steal Earthshake skills)
the curse of TI has been broke
rekt chinese plebs
Hey sir Why miracle banned in Chongqing major?..... Chinese banned Ti winner? Rlly
55:14 when you can't contain the feeling that you know at this point you are the winner!
"Wasn't PSG lgd suppose to be humble ? OG looked a lot more humble here and they are known to be toxic, damn !"
"I'm a big fan of LGD and I was kinda disappointed when they lost, but I'm really happy for Notail, dude deserves to be a champ after what he's been through."
Have you Note They’re Told Ana Tell Them When BS SS Ana Said I can’t even seen my hero lol 🤣
"hey wheres the fucking dodge?
u serious?"
"Music at 41:44, anyone?"
Such a good editing by the Dota 2 team. Good Job guys
this is inspiring
I got goosebumps 😂
"Without doubt, the best TI."
don't celebrate early
След инт выиграют казахи скриньте!!!
I m learning French after this
20:16 Cao ni ma
20:16 Cao ni ma
holy shit ceb is holding a bunch of paper
Best TI ever
This is damn beautiful
"Shit, watching the TI8 finals live then I believed Ana was the mvp. But after watching this bts documentary, there's no question Ceb was the real mvp with his leadership and optimism throughout the series."
1 hour of chinese trashtalk...why im watching this😑
"Goosebumps!! Picks donn matter, it is all about the spirit! LGD was so depressed n quiet! On the other hand..................... OG - History!"
LGD is too cocky when it comes to winning and keeps on underestimating OG but when the pressure comes they break. I guess that's the difference between playing to win and playing for fun. :)
"Fuckin' topson has a strong mindset, he tanked all of LGD's onslaughts he's boss. All throughout the games, he's the one getting camped and ganked all the fucking time during that best of 5 grand final."
Fucking beautiful
"Really cool, i love it"
Amazing animations!!
King of smoke at 4:09
30:55 7Mad :D pour les FR
что за гавно пики пиздец
That sure killed LGD's pride
fuck ceb is such a great motivator dammit!!!
"Og is simply the best.
7ckingmad: you want invoker?
Topson: yeah
7cking: give the boy invoker"
OKAY THIS WAS THE MOST SATISFYING THING DONE BY VALVE.......
skill win games but mindset win championship :)
One of the best Dota movies I have seen ..
Notail is goddamn good at giving advices
"жалко, что фильм только про финал, а не весь интик"
300% zeus wow ez ez ez
"LGD IS WAY TOO FCKING ARROGANT, FCKN HATE THEM SO MUCH, DONT UNDERESTIMATE THE 4 TIMES FCKN MAJOR CHAMPION."
300% zeus wow ez ez ez
51:48 Всё ахуенно ребят!
Win or lose FY did his best to go this far. So proud of him despite the Chinese community
given me goosebumps
So fucking emotional
Wooow
31:42 мудак!?

55:36 i see fy as a cool guy who don't look on explosions. Is it just me?

CEB. Is everything
CEB <3
Man this Video is so great!! Love it!
41:16
"Damn man OG handled pressure sooo well even when they lost.. they kept their cool didnt blame anyone and won..
But LGD when they lost game 4, coach said ' 2 lanes were out, rosh was there you guys didnt take rosh, one guy wasn't there' .. that was wrong and broke them down in so many levels"
"Anyone remeber?
True Sight of ti7.
When kuroky said”don’t think about winning”.
-Focus on this game.
Thats what OG did."
Seb-legendary man)
Best Dota2 Movie Ever! Congratulations OG!

Im so mad that they skipped Ana's ember eul dodged the echo slam scene
"what the lesson can we pick from this true sight ?

Йохан бог
is it just me or you guys can see clearly Notail at Kiev's True Sight looks more enjoying the Game than at this True Sight.. guess Fly break his heart so bad.. sends flower to TI Champ
БИГ ДЭДДИ КЛАБ
35:58 GIVE ME FCKIN CHILLS MANNN!
"Ceb not only carried the game.

*FIST BUMP*
And after several moments, OG won TI8."
8:50 muted 😁😁

Ceb be like. Give the boi invoker
2:45 Alt+tab ana 😂😂
This moment where you're a gamer but feels like an actor of an AMAZING movies.
36:00 omgush
"Ceb is real player , coah and everything to put up og to win ^_^"
first time watching youtube without seen the comment..
"OG's mentality had been boost by Ceb.  Those Ceb's word make their friend feeling confident, even on fucked condition"
55:36 Me at parties
"now i need OG vs EG true sight, please make it happen sir"
"11:43 i see bananas, i like the video"
Disban all LGD fans
Frickin Cebbbb is a legend captain of Dota2.
2:46 ana the real introvert
"LGD showing no respect, about 80% of their conversation was insulting, if the subtitles showed the real meaning of their talkings."
Tusk King
Best true sight so far
just by looking at n0tails eyes at 3:46 you now he's a good guy
24:07 The most exciting moment of all video: the fans support their team like no one did! The fans are hyping their moral up! Beautiful!
"sorry fy, second ti in the final loss"
I've waiting for 1year since 2018 and now 2019  😂
song  minute 37:00 please u.u

I guess go home china?
i like how ceb motivate his team.
"No emotion when ana dodge the echo slam with euls

Feels bad man. Still love this true sight"
damn. Fy is the only likeable player in LGD. He is actually so composed.
"37:29 
Jerax : Memes ?
Ana : ಠ__ಠ"
where is the bog comeback??!
I like the beat
This is truly Beautiful.
"I wasn't happy with OG going into the finals, but man - this spirit of companionship and sportsmanship and overall feeling of accomplishment and joy gets to me. I envy them a lot, of course. Having a team like that must feel the best."
"He played the best dota i have ever seen 
#BigdaddyNotail"
"just epic, guys!"
What about the quick item sell for ana :<
The LGD fans faces tho
"I hate psg lgd so much, their mental build up when they can trashtalk, and when they cant, their mental spirit is broke down, not like OG being positive and keep those spirit to win even without understimated their enemies, love it. 7FckngMad is the MVP what a player and what a coach"
"i miss a lots of important moments of this TI finals, 7/10  is my rating (cri evr time)"
"fucking hell, they dare to pick axe in front of the tusk king? 

by : stupid fy xD

ez comeback by superb axe"
38:40 ceeeeeeeeeeeebbbbbbbbbb - 11.2 million dollar call of his life

"This is why i hate chinese crowds (altough i'am chinese too)
they instantly went silent when their team losing

like come on guys, do you really come to watch dota?
if you want good endings, just watch chinese drama movie or something at home

Триумф командного Духа
Nice
"37:27 *suppressed burp* ""Memes"" XD"
"Думал в сердце есть место только для одного ТИай, но как же я ошибался. 2013 <3 2018 <3"

"I don't understand anything at Dota 2, but this is fucking awesome to watch"
55:37 - When your mom starts walking angrily to your room but you still continue playing.
This is 2nd trending worldwide congrats
"It's just unreal emotions! I am extremely happy for Notail ! After the betrayal of a friend and the team meeting at the last moment, going all the way from the group stages. He could! He did it! I am extremely happy, as I was once happy for Kuroki"

True sight: OG Vs EG next pls
Fuck man this shit is so crazy even though I know whose gonna win I still feel these intense games
"Ana: I don't even know where my hero is


*proceeds to win TI*"
Ana is fucking God man
"This is best TI yet that ever happened. I could say that I've rooted for LGD because they were the crowd favorite and they were the team that everybody expected to win because of this ""TI CURSE"" thingy. Things were pretty unexpected. I felt amazed when N0tail defied the odds, broke the curse, and proved himself he doesn't need Fly. I was pretty butthurt after the loss for the team that I have rooted but I realized OG deserved it better because they showcased their talents pretty well. I am looking forward for another TI like this, Fun to watch, and teams that would defy the odds that are against them."
Просто оставлю это здесь)
Я думал фильм будет лучше ....
Is it just me or xNova looks like Singsing? Like wth? I thought It was mastah sing for a second
HOolllyy ffck
Hats off to Ceb! He really carried the teams morale!
Аж всплакнул😢
"Lets us pray and thanks valve for the amazing TI,

Our Father,

Who glyphs in heaven

Godlike be thy Name

Thy MMR come

Thy balance be done in RL, As it is in DotA

Give us this day our daily mango

And forgive us our feeds, As we forgive those who feed against us.

Lead us not into salt

But deliver us from HoN or LoL

For DotA is the Kingdom of The Balance and The Power forever and ever

Gaben."

Base on my observation chinese like to speak mean words but easily offended. Fucking small dick people
Goosebumps...this is the best movie Esport..
"This is the best True Sight video. Quality of all videos have been improved since the first one, more exciting and sensational. It's fucking worth a long wait for this video."
The ingame cinematic gave me goosebumps. Amazing movie.
2:46 what was Ana watching at that moment?
"Imagine it coupled with hans zimmer music, lets say interstellar background music."

"*Smoking battle*

Ex COACH who always support the player 



Just like...when topson confuse againts lina or zeus he always support what topson pick and make sure topson to play"
Дождались... Это был самый лучший TI за всё его существование!
It still give me chills Axe Call 38:48 then saves PL. Game changer!!!
22:10 best animation
LGD is so salty af
"Ame and Topson really dont talk much, do they."
"This is what i live for man !!
Best Game in the world <3"
The 3D animation so damn satisfying😍
This was so well made and so hype that I couldn't believe it was over
and why the fuck is lgd so cocky
tbh Ceb made them win TI. so positive attitude (Y)  What a player he is!! #respect
2:45 when someone caught you watching porn
Is Ceb french?
"Блять, китайские фанаты умеют только рот открывать и все? В одной позе сидят каждый кадр. Пздц товарищи"
WE ARE ON EDGE!
Bruh the chills!!😲😲
I'm crying :')
i love ceb
"Lets be honest. No one expected OG to come out like this. Roster tore apart, changed roles, them Fly dramas, Ceb coming in, getting a rookie from twitch.

Some titles are won by stacked team. But no one will ever forget how OG won TI8."
9:19 top ten anime fights
the power of flower and sebats dulu
this's dota!
If they start to smash us lets smash them back xD
Probably the best movie and Ceb axe and fy tusk was the real mvp
14:47 - that “Kunkka”... Im actually scared of this guy
One team having fun and the other just working.
Why heroes wear non their real sets in ingame video? Dis
"I always wanted to be a pro player, but whenever I watch valve’s true sight makes me feel like the gap is just way too big. The mindset, the calls, the strategies."
38:39 Top ten pictures taken right before a disaster
SUBARASHI!!!!
Oten gaming

"Oppa,Oppa,Boys!!!"
"Am I the only one getting goosebumps in these animations? It's just amazing, makes me wanna play dota until i get 70 yrs old"
28:17 one who calls himself king is no true king.
"LGD
- must win
- pressured
- serious during game

OG
- win or lose we're ready
- we'll crush them (even in dire situation)
- laughs during game

The big diff is they're are prepared to lose. And just wanna play doto."
Imagine losing and having 20+ cameras right in your face!! Jeezzz
"imagine if TNC climb up to finals, we will hear PUTANGINA, TANG INAMO BUHAY KPA, BOBO NYA, HAHAH IYAK, HAHAHEUT hays sayang"
55:03 i think nova is gona cry
39:16 ana the whole time

The mindset of both the teams after the 4th game says everything.
HE GETS THE CALL OF HIS LIFETIME!
HOLY FUUCK WE WAITING 5 MONTH AFTER TI FOR THIS SHIT SO LONG TIME BUT THANKS FOR TRUE SIGHT
Where's the echo dodged? Lol
Ceb very very good strategy

54:00 Why are there so many canadian flags?
Ohh fuck.. I deeply touched.. Can I say that this is the best documentary ever?? Who agreed??😂
SLAY SLAY SLAY !!
38:40 ❤ that call.
Can we get true sight of OG vs EG?
now we need a reaction video from OG
"Seb is extremely persuasive and positive all the time, I wish that dude a great future. He just kept their shit together all the time"
"POSITIVE MENTAL ATTITUDE
KEEP SPIRIT
WP OG IN TI 2018"
"Молодцы! Очень рад за них, особенно за Notail-а он заслужил это. 55:19 )))))))))))))) 59:46 VERY NICE GAME bro!!!!!!"
"missing the insane bubble defense from topson arc warden and the 11 million dollar eul's from ana ember in the last game dodging a potential game losing echo slam, they should have animated those two as well, also I am staggered on how can Ame be silent throughout the whole thing, that's the real problem for them still today I think"
:) Goosebumps and goosebumps . Long live Dota2 <3
GIVE A BOT INVOKER!
"OG: LETS DO THIS BOIIII
ANA:😐.....

OG: WE WILL FKIN DO THIS!!
ANA:😐.....

*OG WINS A CRUCIAL TEAMFIGHT*
ANA:😐.....

*OG WINS TI8* 
ANA:😐.....

LMAO!!! ANA THE LEGEND!!”"
OG's fighting spirit during the game is so commendable. These people really deserve to win the TI. Kodus!
КАК ЖЕ ЭТО АХУЕННО. СПАСИБО ЗА ТРУСАЙД!!!❤️❤️❤️
51:46 Nice global silence by OG
Does anyone see that the other commentator can't say anything haha
"17:37 как можно было перевести feels bad man?!?!,!?!?!?!????"
"a pure aftermovie i've ever seen. it feels like i really-really there watching them playing. well done true sight crew, and thank you for making this wicked documentary."
"39:17

38:46 holy mother of the monkeys uncle
"I really like how n0tail being so positive! Well done, Big Daddy"
What I wanted was true sight of OG vs EG from upper bracket!
They deserved it! Hands down to OG. I cried fck!
54:44 look at those chinese faces LOL
39:10 **me most of the time when i play with illusion based heroes
I need Notail's wisdom >_<
it's one of the best things i've ever seen...
"""Johan Prophet, anybody?"" XD"
"This is the best document that valve ever to made👏👏 Well Played Valve, Congrats.. OG"
Best Cinderella story
N0tail sebat mulu 😂
Holy sh*t this video was awesome!
best final ever
"at 37:27 

Jerax: Ana wanna relo into the base? Memes ? 
Ana: fuck off

HAHAHAHHA FUCKING JERAX CHILL ASF. Making jokes at the grandfinals"
They lose becaise theyre arrogant. Tusk king? Wtff
Best true sight so far....
Beautiful Doto
"7:20 Never forgive, never forget   *cries* T_T"
GO HOME OG... with aegis and 11 million dollars!!!
14:14 we cant draft good lest pick first and second pick
where's fly?
WOW what a masterpiece!!! Perfectly done
"""Ceb it's real"" lol😂😂😂😂"
The best fcking game in the whole world!!!!
"I have never wanted two teams to win so badly, I love both of these teams, my God. Congratz to OG, truly wanted Anna & BigDaddy esp to win but Omg Fy should win a TI. Amazing teams. Got me crying and shit."
9:24 Somnus face when he got Pogged.
LIKE I SAID RELEASE THE BEAST ANA BABY!!!
"59:27 
You all know he was thinking about Fly"
подружку себа в лс
"OG 100% Power : ana,jerAX,n0tail,Ceb,Topson
OG 99% Power : ana"
Like watching a Shounen Sports Anime Damn!
OG just casually carrying bananas in front of the camera
if LGD had ceb in their boot then they would have won. LGD players were so stressed n tensed
Og блядь!!!
36:00 I can feel it how badass this gonna be
Humbles og wins it all
1:00:14 😭😭😢😢😢 Og 💚
Pause at 9:45 Moment when things gets serious and intense
Write it down boys. I will attend in TI 9. Let's see it.
STILL BELIEVE IN OG!!
I hate how psglgd said shit about Ceb and his papers and draft. Never shit talk before winning. Lesson learned
"""Teams that win game 1 always lose the finals."" 12:42 hahaha. They don't know what's coming. XD"
55:39 thats me in christmas and new year.
☺️❤️
am I the only one noticed the no smoking sign at 17:39?
Tusk king my ass ?
"take all my money for this video, ohh man too good in this video !!!!!"
thank u for this
Шедевр
"Many clips was not included. Example the , selling of ana's  aquila to have buyback and the fast reflexes euls to dodge the echo of FY... The movie is great though!!! Thumbs up.. GGWp"
best ti and best true sight
"it's so dramatic, i'm crying :') beautifull guys"
OG truly deserved the victory. The final was a rollercoaster for them but they managed to come back every time. CEB PLAYED THE VITAL ROLE IN BOOSTING THE CONFIDENCE AND MORALE OF THE TEAM. HE IS FCKING CEB THE TRUE TI WINNER.
who's cutting the onions?
CEB... the real definition of PMA .. he really ligthen up the mood after down 2-1
power of magic lineup
Udud mankk
That was a journey
CEB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Gets the call of his life LETS FUCKING GO OG!
"OG is lucky they dodged the only team that they cant beat. ""Liquid""
as for the stats OG NEVER won a single match against Liquid since Epicenter Moscow Season 2.

check this link to cry : 
https://www.joindota.com/en/matches/236694-og-vs-team-liquid"
Got really hyped at 38:40
*Admit it guy it's more enjoyable watching true sight than watching some 1-2 hours movies.*
Best TI hands down
"I'm just happy to see that at the final game of TI9 Bigdaddy played it like how he used to play when he was new in the scene. as the crazy, orginal, unorthodox support, N0tail."
GG dude
LGD加油，今年下半年，中美合拍，上海开机，干爹夺冠。
THIS IS AMAZING
55:39
That Cinematic moment at 22:10 with Lina and Wyvern trying to Kill Phoenix is probably the coolest cinematic in this true sight edition
Ana the mvp
"Truesight of the Kiev Major was far better because it was focused more on the players emotions, reactions during the games. This one was focused on a more artistic perspective of the game. Nobody wants to see a movie clip instead of the game perspective of how exactly has been played. Decent movie."
"Before the true sight I dislike notail. But after this, I respect him and understand him and starting to like him."
First time i play doto and follow them to the pro scene then i saw OG when they won at Kiev Major i see the true sight and idk how but i loved them just in 36 minutes 1st fav team OG last fav team OG :) ilTW nexto generation :) glhf
Finally...
what an emotional movie 🙂
"I cant imagine how it felt for ceb to be on that stage, much less to be there as a WINNER.  He was never even supposed to play pro again and then fly and s4 screwed them and he had no choice and did he ever show up for OG."
Love OG 💚💚💚
An hour went by just like that. What an amazing insight on TI8.
КАКИЕ ЖЕ ОГ КАК КОМАНДА СЕБЯ ОТЛИЧНО ПОКАЗАЛА
I really enjoyed watching this video!! Go OG I'm rooting you!
"I'm raged and emotional and pumped all the same time idk how to describe this feeling.

#OGforLIFE"
40:34 wtf two 7ckngMad's????
"wow i didn't know game  had zeus,magnus,np and rubick lmfao, been a very long time i guess.I do remember ember tho."
"They picked the hero that they can have fun with not to compete 

Salute to ceb."
that ending holy fuck
love and hate the game at the same time
beautiful.
Ceb MVP those words he used
Love this story
This so fucking dope.
"""Never forgive, never forget"""
"Fy said ""lets block the user"" HAHAHAGA"
BigDaddyNotail u deserve it
"Ceb : Never forgive, Never forget. Notail : Stares down at fly 😂"
"Пока смотрел, сгрыз все ногти на всех конечностях"
"good, good..."
So cute 29:48
"This is next level documentary movie, Valve!"
fuck china
Am i the one who cries watching notail expression?
"ceb is just most motivvavting player in the game,i've ever seen."
RIP arogant LGD lul
35:55 Chills
Does no one acknowledge how powerful a leader 7ckingmad is?
"Lakad Matataaaag. Normally, normally"
Ana : Is Ember still good ?
"game 4:
LGD: DAFUCK CAN PL DO?
game 5:
also lgd:im banning pl"
Gods of comback
That banana really save them.
Oh my Gooooood!! That Ceb's Axe moment!!!!
2:43 xD
gg
global silence works perfectly ON LGD FANS
"50:46 The staff was also like ""How the hell?"" HAHAHAHA"
"Забавные факты:
1 ты не можешь увидеть свои уши без зеркала

CHINA DOTO ARE BEAST
"Notail silence after talking about playing TI final 2016 > Sccc Darth Vader like silence after 2017 TI defeat

Both scenes speak a million words. Love your work Valve"
is this tears in my eyes
the drama is real
Sad lgd.......
"Whoever make this film, has learn a lot how to make dota replay from dota wtf. Well done"
"The Power of Friendship is real guys, no matter his ex bestfriend fly and s4 left them but with the real power of friendship they become so powerful and beat LGD and another team. this can be a meaningful lessons for us in our real life guys. prove it!"
"11:01 (LGD after losing 1st game) it's okay, one extra match. I think they expecting beat OG 3:0"
"OG secret weapon ""LAKAT MATATAG, NORMALIN NORMALIN"""
"8:50 
All muted 
ZuLUL"
"LGD is arrogant, they thought they already win TI8. Executed? Block the user? OG go home? What a toxic relationship? Come on , don’t be so arrogant and toxic and don’t celebrate too early next time..."
"they scream go home OG and then what happen? GGWP to the both, they have a marvelous run in TI8. THE BEST TRUE SIGHT EVER."
54:32 upss i Pressed global silence....
What is the soundtrack? 7:20
I expected OG v EG actually
If you actually understands Chinese you'd realise how rude and obnoxious these Chinese players are. Nimabi. Take the L you halfwits.
"""CEB IT'S REAL, CEB IT'S REAL!"" Man... Ceb really had to put up a facade that everything is ok, it's not a problem that they are down to 2-1, that it's not a problem that Topson was dying because they ganked him so much. He really put all of the negative emotions OG should've felt during those series on his shoulders and when it's all over he just collapses. Well done ceb, well fucking done!"
ceb its real ceb its real that emotion in his voice thats y i love dota man <3
"From ti7, china namba tu"
Terrorblade running is the best
wow.. beautiful
Literally cry in the end.... NOTAIL! YOU DESERVE IT!
*This is a test* ~ n0tail
20:14 when the bell rangs and your teacher still discusses a new lesson .
Now! I totally understood how the OG won the TI. They really motivate and support its other even they lose the match.
man..watching dogson carried by og especially ceb gives me a headache!
"Its like fucking benzema miss compilation

Cant even finish what should be 100% goal"
The emotions are so intense tho. The best comeback tho.
*FY best of the best. You are the Legend of Dota.*
Goosebumps...
The words of notail in the end are like cherry on top of the cake
40:27 thats why they won. xboct's school
"I dont know whats more satisfying, the fact that OG won, or the looks of the Chinese Community during game 5 ahahahah"
china numba two
HOOO... Ibeen waiting this for so long...
I almost cry 😢 😭
"Before seeing video: WHAT MAKE YOU SO LONG IN THIS TRUE SIGHT!?
Seeing video: YOU ARE GODDAMN HERO!!"
"вместо топовых замесов вставили какую-то хуйню блять  анимэшную, хуеплеты валв"
Слова Нотэила в конце... просто нет слов.
The best
15000 hrs on dota and notail got t1.. i have 17k hrs and stuck in ancient 3. PepeHands
"best final TI, BEST TRUE SIGHT"
The best true sight
"Dude. Is it just me thinking that OG, they fucking played for fun. Not like PSG.LGD, too fcking serious and their player seem so arrogant :/"
"OG is nothing without Ana , just watching their performance in Minor"
mo tail is smoking :((
"this video so very2 emotional and OG play the best 
i cant believe OG win the TI 2018 
never give up OG"
"This TI was really an epic movie love, hatred , betrayals , team spirit and unity . No matter what we go together we win together or we lose together .Well done OG"
16:30 he got no escape im afraid :v
SAD
Best truesight !!!!
"from this moment i learned the only one thing. 
""u Trashtalk, u lose""."
Topson's tenacity is still staggering after some tough games. Overall OG's team spirit and positivity is inspirational.
6:33  is the moment you are looking for
Valve is so wise not releasing chinese subs.
Oh my n0tail
"Dude, I can almost taste all of those emotions. I can almost feel their win.

I've been an OG fan since The Frankfurt Major. All these emotion roller coaster, winning those majors, failing 2 TIs.
I didn't regret one bit believing in them and this game.

I don't fucking need a pretentious inspiring people, I have this to motivate me.

Thanks, Valve! This is probably the most beautiful esports movie ever.

Thanks Johan, thanks."
They didn't include ana's euls when he got caught:<
"That was so fucking cool. Thx OG, Valve from Russia"
i see Topson feel angry at game3
"One of the best true sight i've ever watch,worth a time to wait it been released
Bo5 true sight is the best!!!"
LGD
"That's what you get when you insult Ceb's papers.

The best TI as of now."
Those who dislikes are Chinesse who dont like OG Winning TI 😂
Best TI!!  Ever!  ♥  You did it guys! 😊
am i the only one crying :/
Amazing!!!
I also laugh at 31:04 as JerAx did HAHAHAHA 😂
TT^TT
Notail: The face of OG! :D
Ts of TI7 is better
Lol I didn't know that notail likes to smoke not just in the game
"Ceb, my man."
I think I like suess
true sight OG vs EG pls
38:40 i got goose bumps here
"hahahahha got global silenced +talent tree + refresher shard and orb = Owned for saying ""Go Home OG"""
been waiting for ages.. nice!!!
Ceb a true leader. Believing in everyone's strength no matter what happens. Win or lose just enjoy the game.
ANA ember spirit <3
55:36 can make a meme now.
#Cringe
the best ti grand finals maybe i think
THE. BEST. TRUE. SIGHT. EVER.
Русские тут? С победой OG!!!  With the victory OG!!!
"It was nice to get to know the Chinese players a bit more. Somnus seems like a likeable guy, kind of natural comedian with his facial expressions and deadpan comments. FY seems super serious and focused, scary-looking almost sometimes. Sucks that there has to be loser in sports but there it is. I think this doco missed some of the best moments in that last game though (Ana's dodges to top and bottom lane fights)."
"Let's be real guys, obviously they swear not because they hate each other, but to cover up their nervous and even normal people do keep saying 'fuck' with their best friends without truly meaning it, they are just trying to making the team to have better mental and not too nervous. And the fans well, every fans are bias and hoping the best for their supported teams so sometimes they might g too over by trash talk other teams but still it is pretty normal. Stop spreading hate and every players fight with their efforts and they do deserve what they won."
RESPECT TO CEB HIS ALWAYS POSITIVE NO MATTER WHAT !
"36:38 38:41 Ceb God making the play, u really deserve the TI"
respect the both team
CEEEEEEEEEB!!!
Can i know the time when Ceb started talking in French and Valve even cant translate?
FUCK U FLY xD
39:11 you can see in Ana's eyes that he is saying the truth hahahaha
Mute and block them wtf lgd ??? Haha cocky bastards well deserved lose
Love U Somnus😘😘
OMG This is amazing! At last seconds i cant breath... like noTail
#goog
why topias is so shy in cameras
"Well LGD members said that OG is the worst team that only know how to play defensive n hold late game, showing disdain to OG with verbal abuse like noob af something (ofcoz the translator didnt translate that into subtitles), but the result showed that arrogant dont make you a bttr team. Rofl china"
Anyone gonna comment about the editing? Bloody brilliant!!
"GabeN slay, slay,slay chatwheel please"
"Funny how Chinese teams always regard themselves as Gods or the best in the world. If you look at the other TI Winners before, you'll see that they only play for fun and not to win. That's true sportsmanship, which some Chinese teams clearly dont have."
LGD much better team than OG.
Cry for LGD.... Its soo sad for themm😔😞......
"""Go fucking Ember, I trust your fucking Ember"".


*Well* ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"Alright, NOW GIVES US EG VS OG TRUE SIGHT, WE WANNA SEE TAL'S REACTION AGAINTS HIS BROTHER"
"this shouldve got into cinemas,much better than some movies,well deserved win for OG"
I really liked it at the end when the rice farmers walked in silence :))
"""He's Won Nothing Before This"" and Topson do it"
"With that kind of mentalities, they're really deserved to win the final.."
This True Sight break a Myth hahaha
is this new marvel movie?
Did notail just smoke like a fuck ton of cigs
I cried
https://youtu.be/bZqtD47VnxY
"05:28 hahhahahhahahahhahahhah, lol, if yo now what they mean 🤣"
Wtf is this then game 3
True blessing to have Ceb in the DotA scene. What a player..
"45:24 Ana: You think Ember still  good ?
goddamn right"
The moment jerax laughs ceb instantly scold him lol
"is it just me or for every chinese audience scene, most of them open their mouths while watching?just an observation tho"
WTF we have been waiting for such a long time! FUCK.. worth it.
OG deserved their TI8 they focus on playing the game. At 1st they seems like not confident but positive to give their best win or loss.. Unlike LGD they fucked up overestimating themselves. CEB was like the heart of the team.. His axe carried hard on G4.. This documentary is the best :).
"Hi guys can you share your reason why you love DOTA2

me i love this kind of momentum really loved the hype"
"7:21 ""never fogive, never forget"""
OG still having fun even they are under pressure😂 that's why they won TI8! 😍
37:29 Jerax Pepega
38:49
Amazing 👏
Epic.
hahaha magnus shockwave pullback even tho it still didnt when ti8 was still ongoing.
"fookingmad is a douche imo but a great coach/motivator/player  #respect for this dude.
Ana would have tilted real hard if it wasn't for 7mad or is ana always like that?"
TRENDING 2. This is one of the best TI in history so far.
PMA > Cockiness is what I learned from this True Sight and to everyone who put a lot of effort into making this Movie... all I want to say is Thank You ❤️❤️❤️ The Best True Sight that lives up to the hype
"Hmm did they put ""Recorded in Manila Major 2016"" in the last minute of the video to hint that the next TI would be in the Philippines? salty comments incoming.hahaha.."
im not crying .. youre crying !!
"почему эти китайцы такие чсвшные, желчные ублюдки, которые проиграли словно клише-злодеи"
Hey ceb its reall... Hey ceb its real hey
1 Hour is not enough
"25:24 ""don't jinx it"" ahahah"
So Happy to See OG win. China attitude really like .... they deserve to lose TI8 with this attitude. Congraz OG
CEB god💖
ANA VS. LGD
sad they didnt include the 11 million eul by ana 😂😂😂
Fvcing topson... He looks like a drugs dealer... Damn
"12:25

https://youtu.be/llHhiiNnIjY"
To tears...
5:40 Fastest Mute in the West
"This happened months ago...
But watching it feels like yesterday"
"Spam flower to give notail power 
Flower power"
A great documentary ... With 4 Majors and a TI OG is probably the most consistent team .... But can they do it again ....? Can they lift the curse of the Aegis? Can they become the first team to win two TIs ? That's the race now.
The best OG.
OG sponsored by Bananas
If you don't smoke are you a pro tho?
"За русские субтитры лайк, без вопросов!)"
i wish they could change to aegis into the new one . Just my personal opinion
"upper bracket for bitches
-2017"
OG fun detected: https://youtu.be/Bv4CqIxqTMA?t=3343
30:40 Lakad Matatag!!! Normalin. Normalin
This is so good!
I hate it when china’s crowd said “go home OG” its like they don’t give og any respect
"This is probably the most emotional TI finals and the fact they made this for fans to see. The nerves from OG is just madness, so much adrenaline, and even laughing at such intense moments."
Is Ceb the most positive player?
Dota is a game where you can make the spectator cry also. Just watch the reaction of the spectator in TI.
I just cried after watching this. Such a historic run for OG.

Welp. Time For more DOTOS!
Chinese should not win TI or they will be next Wings.. i mean OG just safe psg.lgd and liquid safe newbee
TL;DR >>  Fake TI winner's trash talks
The last part tho. Goosebumps
Props to casters especially odpixel for keeping the game alive for the viewers. His hype for the game makes this thing interesting. The guy cant even stay to his seat! Amazing talent.
227 of chinese population dislike da video
14:45 kunkkaaaaaaaa 🔥👌
почему русских субтитров почти нет ?...
n0tail looked a lot skinnier that TI
"Всем привет, русские есть?"
dota is really mental war - NOtail right
I've waited too long for this. What a great vid! Goosebumps!
Yo my fellow pinoys listen to OG.Diaz at 16:23 hahahahhaha lol
"Probably the longest true sight time ""1:00:14"", agree?"
"Бля, охуенно конечно, но было бы куда пизже, еслиб там были наши...."
Make another one:)
"First time watch video without skip, and much replay if lost the 1sec moment 😁"
This is awesome. Its round 10 months last time I played dota bcuz im so bz with work. But damm TI 8 was great. Thank you pro players and to the dota community who help and make TI at its best. I look forward playing again and the up coming TI9. 🙄
OG's optimism was just incredible. Well deserved win
GO HOME OG? EZ LGD BOIIISS
ana true mvp
"55:13 , best moment life has to give. thank me now"

Goosebumps all over my body while watching it! Can't wait for the  next TI.
Best vid that I have ever watched. Give me chills for one hour straight. Great job Valve!
BLOCK THE USER....LMFAO
Damn! I wonder what those notes contain?
“Go home OG”? Asian being Asian smh
"i can buy ducati panigale 1199 after this game , thanks a lot og !! comeback my money :)"
Thank you for making such a great work and Thank you OG and PSG.LGD for the story we'll never forget.
"Thanks TrueSight, you're giving me another reason to hate the chinese Doto :)"
Bring Back OpenAI :)
that ceb is the heart of og ..... does his heart make of steel? XD .... omg that nerves
best of ti shit
"i think its all comes down to game 4 and 5. i can clearly see the mentality. 
i mean... OG. as a team when shits just happened, sure they mourned a little, then i goes back into fun talk. the mentality getting back up. notice that they lost horribly during the laning phase. what did they do? they dont blame anyone, they encourage each other.
i mean.. Ceb was such a good guy. topson having a hard time during early game 4. ""its ok its ok. im gonna fuck them"" such confident in his axe. and it wasnt just a talk, call into sunstrike combo, getting topson back in the map.
such focus from ana.. i mean he cant even notice jerax talking to him, for me personally, if i was too focused on something, suddenly everything went mute. i guess thats what it is.
during game 5. the same thing happened. ""hey we got topson's zeus, ana's ember."" its ok we got late game"".
and i think.. the turning point was after the rosh fight. what happened here? prophet baiting them, lgd, thinking they had the opening, used everything they got on him. then come the 2nd fight. jerax, being a great ES player himself know exactly whats gonna happen, he told them to man up, ""no echo he got nothing!"" and i can see pretty well the rubick always man marking the ES, look at the amount of that stolen fissure.
im not trying to say anything but, its obvious in term of mentality, when shit happens, LGD start blaming each other. only when the captain FY tell them its fine, then they shut the fuck up, even then, they know it wasnt ok, they just cant say it out loud.
i mean im an asian myself, i found that.. was always a thing here. wtf is wrong with us guys."
PILLS HERE!! 17:29
GG OG!!!!
54:45 dont cryy
"That was the best True Sight so far. Been rooting for my Guys, Jerax and Ana. What a series, this was. 😎"
"yesterday they mentioned a director's cut thats gonna be released ""later""? Someone knows anyithing about that?"
I'm sorry I really like OG but I can't support em

Папич в бане уёбки даже true sight не помогает(
Ceb saved game 4
"That's why such team as Liquid and OG won the TI, they have the strong team spirit and support each other everytime. They play finals not thinking about win but just for doing their best. They deserve this."
55:19 RIP the table lol. Amazing episode. Great job to the team!
"On losses

LGD: WTF HOWD WE LOSE FUCK THEM"
"The best TI final ever...Im crying watchin this😭😭

Lesson learned from psg.LGD dont happy too early and dont keep looking down enemy when u just win 2 matches of BO5
"Im crying. Its so beautiful.


But now they cant even get pass a Minor, GG TI curse."
No real game 3 ? No og comeback so sad 😢😢
notail & ceb had a incredible character.. you need a kind of person like that on yor team.. besides this insane coach who became a player! they more than a team.
Finally!! I've been waiting for this
best true sight
That axe call was heroic indeed!
"CEB - The Dark Knight. 
Integral part to OG's win. Respect."
"i love how true sight shows even the losing side perspective, not all sports put emphasis on how strong the losing side is, and not being like media, always shining light on the winners. lessons are learnt from the losers, not the winners."
I love ODPixel's voice in the background making this truly the best true sight ever
Can the Editors please make a  Dota2 based movie? this looks SO awesome.
Look at OG how confidence they are even they lose in game 3 .. they know they're gonna win.
Каеф
Needs more footage of Fly ;(
This shit is better than the fucking avengers
❤️
Ceb the positive guy
Quality fucking content
I want true sight og vs eg please

"As a huge fan of OG and Hontrash, this is still very hard for me to watch. Fy played his heart out in this tournament and his reaction at the end broke my heart."
"It's not just a story, it's a DREAM"
The Chinese talk a lot of shit about their opponents don't they :P
overproud chinese
Это просто АХУЕННО!!!
Biggest thing missing from True Sight is teh drama of the EG/OG feud that they could of hyped with a tiny. Amazing True Sight though! Loved it!

Tusk King no match for mighty Axe
"i think psg.lgd lack of moral boosting during final.. looks like they talk technical only.. on the other hand, ceb do the talk all the time.. boosting their moral even though they loss 2 games straight.. i see the similarity with Liquid on TI7 finals where kuro always boost team morale.."
big emotional amd unexpected play😭

"39:00 ""That is some kreygasm shit"" - Jerax"
Finally

He said it himself: I'm almost willing to die just to win this tournament. And thank god he did. He has grown so much in such a short time. This has been the player I looked up to most, and this will be the player I look up to most - forever."
"that ""go ember"" from ana o.O"
"Ana, a humble and talented player, You rock mate. You guys really deserve the T.I"

why is the girls looks more sad than the boys. do they really plays dota?
sad they didn't show all the swings of the game 4 I waited for a moment OG dived up to t4 and died
OG vs LGD < OG vs EG
55:35 meme of the year
"""GO HOME OG!!!"" - the Chinese really support them to go home with Aegis and 11 million prize. 

I respect that."
Suddenly tis video put a smile on my face. Ti8 is the most colorful TI event ever! BTW Lgd u did a great game! Long live dota bois! 👌🏼
i di dint feel thompson.
Ame spoke only once.... whyyy?
"Ceb is the foundation of OG, when teamates are down quiet and losing hope, he stayed positive, very lively, ""Its ok, were gonna fck em for sure, we got this"" Those kind of mindset is the mindset your gonna have hardtime to break. Were gonna lose together, win together, slay together, slay together, SLAY together."
"You could see who was gonna take the aegis after game 4:

LGD: ""I think I'm getting a headache from playing..""
OG: ""I wanna play some DOTOS!""

OG won with their team spirit."
37:28 haha
the best TI
"really someone who even cant sit at TI8 chair but trashtalk a players
if you didnt like player attitude then what about your attitude?
that normal, because dota2 players is a human
they has greedy, cheeky, and all sins of human
just enjoy the show"
35:57 Epic moment
54:40 fy knew they fucked up bigtime...
when the curse no longer applies! Even years aren't for China anymore
ceb's leadership is very good
Ceb is the man. He's always motivated his teammates from not to giving up. The best history of comeback in dota 2! Inspiration for everyone is not to loose hope. Grats OG!
so nice bitj
"we win together, we lose together, said Ceb. That's why OG win the TI8"
IT'S HERE! IT'S REALLY HERE!!!

The best true sight ever ❤
"For a LGD Fan, it's really hard to watch. Even the title of the video. I've seen the first three Games, and go to sleep because it's too late in Europe. Never thought LGD will lose, especially in that way in the 5th Game. It's heart break."
LGD.FY is still the best team ever for me ! All of their game is not boring so many fight in the game.
ceb батя
52:51 i imagine if this scene remake to manga or anime

SingSing is really good this past TI
"But seriously, where can I buy those pants N0tail was talking about at 2:32?"

Notail really deserves this.
11:46  NO SMOKING

Damn im cry 😂
"I still remember i got so many winnings when i bet on gaming4cash, i'm kinda pressured with my $300 but then again OG gives me chill when they got the victory!"
When the coach become player.. He definitely knows what's inside his teammate's head

Dislike came from Fly

They picked axe in front of a tusk king? wow
"The Music, GOD DAAAAAMN"
"As a Chinese DOTA fan, a LGD fan, I don't dare to watch this video. We will win back at Ti9 Shanghai."
"Love both teams. Still love lgd, china teams always show good games and enterainment. Og or lgd, im still in."
motherfuckers in french ceb GOD
"OMG.  Final, which is better NAVI - Alliance :-)"
"i really love ceb's character always being optimistic and he wasnt even seem on pressure,winning mentality!!!"
Oh man. The feels for both of the teams~
Dota and cursing.. Name a better duo
One of the epic grand finals in the history of esports! Expect the unexpected. CONGRATS OG! You guys really deserved it.
"Ceb mind game was a serious one, especially at Game 5."
"Fy God deserves Ti Winner.
Keep going Fy God!"

"The best T.I. so far! 

N0tail: I strongly believe that if I woke up in the morning and I had to play the TI final, I would play the best DOTA of my life and that's all would matter to me. If I play my very best... nothing else would matter. 

(You gotta love Ceb, too!)"
"Заебись 
спасибо"
"Ceb MVP, being calm and collected when his team started to be discouraged."
22:10 Holy shit

Anyone sweating in the eyes now?
"37:28 Jerax : Ana, you wanna relocate into base? Memes?

Down 2-1 in Grand Finals of TI, thinking of memes. You're the man Jerax."
Anything can work!
Just like a ball game. When NBA final All is from defend.LGD play is amazing but defend is team win the key
Ana and Ceb did it
The animations are making my bodily chemicals go wild... even my heart rates' fluctuating... You might as well kill me now Dota 2 :)
Ceb is the real heroes of OG without his word. OG cannot fight like that
Notail finally achieved his dreams
Psg its just like virtus pro at kiev major
"True Sight TI7 : (28:48)
True Sight TI8 : (1:00:14)"
"oh no, not semi final match og vs psg,  i think that is very interesting 🤔"
dislike 192 LGD fans lol
They missed few moments like Ana selling items for buyback on G4 and dodging echo slam in G5
GANARON DE SUERTE. POBRES CHINITOS :(

"OG always have PMA and CeB omg, he's the most PMA player that I've ever seen and he can motivated his team well"
"As I watching this, the goosebumps during the actual TI8 still hits me, although the the video didn't catch much of the glorious moments, still, props to True Sight! and yeah, Probably the BEST TI so far! DOTA FTW!"
You can feel the pressure as if you’re in the same booth as them

"OG is so confident on crushing every PSGD drafts well played OG! 

PSG:Team up by 1 lose grand finals

"I laughed so hard at Somnus when he said ""Holy Crap, Ceb is holding a bunch of papers"" at 6:31 Its like he knew they're fucked :D"
and this is why DotA is the best game.
"Im going to watch this again later, then tomorrow then everyday."
37:54 that Topson face tho. LMAO

A truly inspiring vid for us. Thanks to valve and to all casts specially Ceb for having a positive mindset throughout the tournament. Love from 🇵🇭
dota died the moment u let a shitty team like og win ti
"45:58 11 Million ""IDK"""
Psg.lgd заслуживали больше этой победы. Og  повезло .
Ceb the true hero. Fy so sad.
I miss ti8 Soo much and this final thank you psg lgd and OG
"Thx valve for true sight about ti8 final oh w8 it's only about 1 team (fucking OG) 
CoolStoryGaben"
Ceb has always been the one getting ridiculed by the community for not living up to s4 as an offlaner but thanks to True Sight we know he was INTEGRAL to OG’s TI 8 victory as he was the one boosting the team’s confidence every step of the way and calling the shots when all hope seems lost. Any team would’ve lost game 4 and 5 but OG stood strong because they were still able to keep such an optimist attitude thanks to his words
59:42 у Джеракса бутылку украли :D
"Honestly, i will give most of the credit to jerax & ceb. Most of the decisions were made by them and those decisions making make them TI8 champ."
36:01 boi o boi that feel
25:17 Fatty just Jinx the game  smh
"5:30 referring to when Crit ""unintentionally"" bumped into Johan's shoulder? Hahaha"
28:11 Let's ceb show skill on King tuks!?
'What's this hero?'   28:10
Topson really got displayed very unfair in this true sight

EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!!
Plz do Russian subs
28:06 monkaS
THE CHILLS MAN!!!
"more than a decade in, i fuckin love this game."
20:12 Fcking rude what they said if u understand u will know deserve  to lose
They didn't put on the subtitles but ceb was swearing left and right in french everytime they killed psg
"OG was a good team, they work hard,work smart, positively,good leadership, and the most important is they just have fun for the game. 

LGd also a good team,strongly,have a professional player,have a good strategy, and they not having fun of that game. 

that is the DIFFERENCE 

just chill even you play at the grandfinal Ti you just need enjoy the game and because of that will remove all yours negative thinking,stress and frustration..



BTW goodluck for the next tournament..wishh luck for  all  dota2 professional players ..this is so nice video that can be inspired of other dota2 player."
"Even though I’m an OG fan I have to give credit to PSG.LGD because their not afraid of being toxic/cocky whether their in game or drafting, they have the typical try hard Chinese stereotype (if we lose it’s because you’re doing a pussy move. If we win it’s because your shit at the game) which may also be their downfall as in game 4 as they were in so much of a lead then because of cockiness  the axe was able to snowballed OG to win the game and give OG the same adrenaline going into game 5."
next year i will be the next TI champ
Woma woma?!
PMA ceb
GO HOME OG? LMAO U LOSEE LGDDD ??
"i dont give a shit about lgd vs og, JUST BRING ME OG VS EG !!!!"
Where's the '1k like button'? I need it. NOW!
"Its pretty Good, BUT where is Ana dodge Echo Slam and Sell Ring of Aquila to save 11 million for OG"
I love the fact that ceb called game 4 as his game. Totally spoke it into existence.
You want that hero? Go for it! They don't feel any pressure . Just fuck it man! Love it!
Feel like one of them. This video has vibe in it
37:20 starting to like memes? jerax be like haha
Could someone identify the Headset used in the series? I really like 1. thanks!

"14:53 bring back open AI, lol =))))"
best true sight ive ever seen
"36:00 is epic af , “they have a really big problem , pl lvl 25 guys” and that background music made it even more scary"
Whenever i watch true sight why does the cocky team always lose?
even lgd's silencer working on the chinese crowd LUL
"OG really deserved to win this event, from the beginning to the end!  This series were one of the most memorable moments in the history of DotA2"
"Greatest series in Dota History, ty OG and LGD.

Alliance vs. Na'vi TI3 still in my heart as the 2nd."
Moral of the story : DON'T DO DRUGS
OG talks too much positiv. LGD talks not too much but smells too negative.
What pills are LGD popping?
big daddy is so bad ass he light the smoke in a no smoking area.
"Every players wants that title. as you can see their emotions. Especially to those who got 2nd place. Its okay, just remember your determination can prove it. Ggwp!"
22:04 *very nice animation omfg*
so goooood
"OG definition of PMA, awesome games!"
"the best TI in history Ti8 
Go home LGD !!! hahaha  
OG the 1st Team who  broke the Curse !!"
this is all good but the real true sight is between notail and fly tho
5k scrub topson noob dick
Ana looks so stressed all the time...
This is so good krappa
Ame is the key of OG's victory. proud of ame

Great editing
This is just beautiful.
"When i see this True Sight with soo much of mind games during draft phase, i really hope i can see Wings Gaming True sight on ti6 finals so that i can see what their reaction during that draft phase."
"fuck china, fuck chinese players, boastful mofos got their ass rekt"
Shit guys.. Im crying 😥😥
Holy s***! Did Ember just sleight of fist some onions?
"53:06 yeah they sure did, but for the real AEGIS..."
"Dang, OG was really the true example of perseverance, hard work, and team work. In hindsight, LGD got to that point with a kind of 'just wing it' mentality, they have no exact planning against OG, just showed that their individual skills are amazing..still, it wasn't enough.."
That's what you get chalice pempengco
"It is amazing,  It is TI,  It is DOTA!"
1 hour WOW

BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR THANK'S VALVE
"There's no ""sell item for buyback"" and ""echo dodge"" for ana. That is what Im expecting to appear. :("
"Fy like "" Fucking eul, fucking eul"""
"Ana, if you have to pee, go pee xDD"
"Ana : is it worth it if i just yolo here?
Notail : just a slow fight in their base, it's all we need. 
...
...
... 
Or kill them (with smile) 

lol"
30:39 'Lakad matataaaag! Normalin normalin!'
the best movie ever
7Mad : We're getting tested. Embrace it.
"i think ti7 true sight way more better than this. kinda lack in content eventho its 1hr long. 
 
ggwp OG !"
06:01 omg
"Its not even the truest sight
We need more an in-depth look into their daily routine before their big match

By that i mean looking into their out of boundaries stuff if you know what i mean 😉😉😉"
"42:49 *""I hit 15,000 hours of Dota during this Finals. 15,000 hours, whatever they have, i have more than them""* .. 

Holy Shit, my Flower boy right there ..."
Amazing Video...I Remember Everyfucking Words OD Was Shouting...Every Single One
Both team showed fighting spirit and never give up. Congrats to both team both were doing really really great. 👍
55:37 When you just realize that you have a lot of homework at the new year's party
This grand final never stop giving me chill
31:45 putahhhhhh

Once again the real french win this series GG ceb
"damn, i wish they made the animation for ana echo slam dodge with eul"
37:29 ana you wanna relo into the base? memes?  fucking jerax memeing in ti finals what a legend
Sumiya's father is FY
turtle but dragon in late game
看一次难受一次。
"im not here to watch a trash team playing without any respect with their chat wheel spam.
just came here to drop a dislike"
Even though i already knew the outcome i still watch the whole hour just to motivate myself
Best movie of my life
🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻
Jerax so chill man...
its alwys interesting wathcing True sight. damn boii
I dont know why jerax saying memes and byebye gives me life
"38:32 gave me some crazy uncontrollable feels , I had been bed ridden for 2 weeks with surgery recovery right when TI popped off , I remember watching the finals live in utter shock and overwhelming enjoyment, and just relived some of those feels now. Regardless I thoroughly enjoyed the production of this video as well as the story and stunning conclusion (even if we already know how it ends ;) !!! Thank you !! 🙏"
"I’m crying after watched this, Dota is the Amazing game ever..."
"36:33

Kreygasm Love the awesome animations. Axe MVP"
"[59:43] Chills man on the last moment he says.

#STARISBORN"
Beautiful picture! Respect from Siberia
best film i've ever see
So much love for PSG.LGD They don't look down them opponent.
"I personally think the only mistake the chinese team made was that they took heart out of the equation. Mechanically strategically they were crazy gifted, yet they myopicaly only focused on victory. They were too aggressive and frankly their coach was hyping them too much. Let the players play the game, im sure china will do amazingly this years ti #bringbacktheTIbalance"
"The best pos 4 so far i see ; Gh, Yapzor, Fy 
Idk sooon i will be like them"
PSG constantly looking at OG's behaviour during the draft might work against them. It'd be funny if Ceb's notes were actually blank sheets just to mess with them.
"N0tail going crazy at 58:57.
Thinking wtf i did in my life together with fly?"
FINALLY ITS OUT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DAMN that a good tiXD
"TI8 is by far the most inspirational TI of all time. Just by watching this vid had given me a lot of emotions. The hype, anxiety, comebacks, trash talks, motivations, and many more. The cinematic scenes brought tears to my eyes though. Every single one of it is powerful."
Lesson learned: Dont just play intellectually sometimes you gotta use your heart and passion in DOTA
lets hit 10 million views guys .. they deserved that much .
52:14 ohhhshittttt Kreygasm
JERAX IS MY BAE ♥ THANK GOODNESS THEIR WON TI8!  LOOKING FORWARD TO TI9 ♥♥OG♥♥
"37:30 
JerAx : Memes?
Ana    : Fuck Off.
I died XD"
the way they created and designed this video thrilled me actually
"Supporting OG for 3+ years and this was seriously the best moment they could ever have despite the hard times they faced in early 2018, heck they are pretty much immortal now,🌻 GG 🌻 OG 🌻"
"LGD (no frenchs in it) Sponsored by PSG,  lost vs a team with 1 french guy in it. Im going to start drinking more redbull :D"
"looking at it again, I wish Wings had their True Sight too."
I'll Praise The Editors Of This Video.Its So Fuqing Sick😍
38:48 i love this scene the most it was like gonna lose the game lose hope lose everything but comeback is real
Wadu Hek
"ceb: I'll destroy him for you

man that confidence..."
POTA~!! - N0tail
Ana hurt his back after carrying the whole team
The ember dodge? That dodge was amazing in the last fight
"This is the best documentary series that I've ever watched. The emotions, the feels its all there"
35:57 the king has arrived
难受
"39:06 Jerax speaks to Ana and he be like ""I don't even know what's going on, I can't even see my hero"" 

😂😂😂 Gets me everytime"
Imagine if TI3 had true sight. That would be a legendary film. Captain S4 against Captain Puppey ♥
"*GO HOME OG*





Well ..."
Team Communication.. It is a big factor... OG is the better Team more than LGD when it comes to Team Communication.. Just my opinion... LGD gave a great battle... TI8 was epic.. Im excited for TI9.. I think we all do... ^_^
"“Win or lose, we don’t care, we play!” - Ceb,2018"

lmao i find it funny these chinese fans chanting “go home OG”
CEB is a great leader
Even I watched many time but its still beautiful 😭🙌🏼

Русские есть?
Ceb is the most positive player in the world
"You know This people say""Go Home OG"" and Notail killing that word"
Wow great teams o.g & lgd
38:15 this is the moment we live for
*WHY AM I CRYING?* FUCK THIS IS SO TOUCHING
@OGflukeTI winner LUL
"HAHA. ""tRue siGHt"" make me laugh. It's always Western sight. Russian, Asian, China are the villian. And if u said: "" The winner is right"". Huh. Where is Wing Gaming, VP True Sight? 
TRUE SIGHT???? HAHAHA ""True sight"""
been waiting for this !!!
I cried
"In spite of their talent and skills, the one weakness of mainland Chinese... They have a hard time with psychological warfare tactics and their first instinct is to assign blame instead of stepping up to take it and rectify the situation. Not racists comment, just observation, non-commie Chinese don't show this predilection."
Boom ID vs TT true sight is better...
The chinese players are abit arrogant while OG respect them
too much arrogance in LGD makes them lose. Commended OG for humility and team work. those words empowers them greatly.
best TI eveeeeeeeer!!!
trash team OG
Notail looks like a 12 years-old with a 50's voice
"9:27 ohh shit so good..
he is like: I just shit pants bruh."
I can't breath
Lmao Chalice
The chinese saying OG go home OG go home and 10 mins later 无语了 lol
"next video pls. ""OG's reacting to True Sight"""
The best ti champ!!
41:49 - drink vodka play dotka
Go home OG?. They're not even at China and acting like that. I don't even know what are they going to do when their team lose Ti9.
10:25 I didn’t know singsing playing in TI
"Tbh this true sight lacking the most important plays of the TI such like ana shopping trip,his ember dodge and so on...but still pretty good work put into it"
"1 hour seem so fast, WTF"
anyone have five times goosebump?
And who the fuck is the cute girl in 54:45
"We can see how both teams fight and struggle for the Aegis but I was more impressed and respect to OG especially Ceb. Having someone in a team who has high moral and always bring positive outlook in every bad situation has a big role and not putting too much pressure in every player. They just play to have fun, ""We win we win, we lose we lose all it matters is to have fun every game"". And they showed us what was once their dream become a reality for them. 
And alsi this is the best 1hr youtube video ever!."
Ceb’s motivational words is out of this world! Haha
Anyone waiting for jerax echo terrorblade? But where is it 😔
What is funny is that you have a French  in OG's team and they are playing against a team that has PSG (famous French football team)  as a sponsor
the attitude of 2 teams was different :o
I like this jerax guy's memes ..
"Это лучше, чем тысячи фильмов. Это шедевр."
"the fans be like... ""Go home OG""... OG use Lotus Orb.... ""PSG.LGD going home""......"
45:03 TI9 chan wheel
“How can we know when they call gg?” pft lmao
"45:25

Ana: lets go ember.
Yohan: depends who are you gonna fuck them with.. 

Haha"
Wtf. Im crying
Im sorry but it wasnt notail who rallied the team.. It was Ceb...
"i mean i dont even know what the fuck's going on , i cant even see my hero

-ana Ti8"
Im sorry but it wasnt notail who rallied the team.. It was Ceb...
PSG.LGD feared and respected OG too much.
12:42..LOOOOOOOOOOL
what the fuck is this bad editing man
"Im pretty sure lgd players have mental problems and also ana, well i think money wont make them happy"
The best thing about OG in ti8 was they keep coming back from a bad game. I never thought about OG reaching the grand finals when their roster was disrupted.
36:32 wow
I missed the Ana echo uels dodge...
Og is lucky to win this TI
0:35 i just love how the camera angle and how it focuses on the faces of LGD players with the seriousness of their look with notail speaking at the background.
So whats with taking out the jacket if LGD wins the TI?
Lol thay guys with wide open arm pit showing his arm put hair 😂😂
"I feel like OG gave PSG LGD way more respect than LGD gave them, OG went in there with 100% effort and prep from the start and it showed. Hearing LGD laugh at Ceb's notes just confused me. If you're allowed to take in notes then why would you not? Its like taking a final exam but ditching your cheat sheet because your overconfident."
31:01 Fuck you!! thats right (shit i cried)
the cinematics
"Ceb is the only one who made this true sight content enjoy to watch. 
Imagine how boring this would be without his pureness encouraging the team."
Fvcking awesome!
"that Notail face at 55:12, that moment when he knows that they are winning, that there are just few more seconds... and he barely sustains his screams, not being able to believe it, not be able to say it out loud... that emotion .... man... my deep respect!"
Last year true sight was better
Ceeeeeeeeeb
"not enough sight from ana, i think ana is mvp and key for OG"
"""Team that win game 1 always lose the finals"" .............. 
Lmao 😂😂😂😂😂"
Fibally
Watching LGD’s reactions to the drafts was fucking hilarious. You could tell they were scared of just what the fuck OG we’re gonna pull out.
I liked most of the animated parts but they really ruined CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB but not showing the actual call in its full glory
Topson's Nose kept on getting redder as they proceed in the series. LMAO
"Not sure if I just watched True Sight

or Interstellar"
FAAAK keren
Next year! Fy will be on his 3rd TI finals and Somnus will get his second and they will get revenge! 😢
MY GOD THIS TRUE SIGHT GIVES ME SO MUCH MOTIVATION IN LIFE !! GG OG!! GG LGD!! YOU GUYS ALREADY SHOW US THE BEAUTY OF PLAYING DOTA
39:54 TI9 chat wheel pls
58:55 thats how JOKER born
Notail laughs like crazy
N0tail <3 <3
Where's og now? 🤣
"Ceb: We're ready to lose & ready to win, We're ready for anything.."
"That YOLO confidence on Seb to just keep everyone in check really won them the series, they had already lost so much and had nothing more to lose that they played the best dota of their life."
38:49 CEEEEEEEEEEEEEB
"key of winning is - communicate even ur team is losing till end
not be at silence. not blaming not tilting 
OG s spirit was stronk boyz"
stop hurting PTSD！！！😢
So many idiots written !arcana all the video. Stupid people.
Kelamaan di post nya hype nya udah kurang
*IM FUCKING CRYING... WTF*
That axe call maaaan! FUUUUUCK! IT MADE ME SHIT MY PANTS.
RUN BLYAT 37:55 LMAO
"Will never forget that game 4


Amazing"
47:53 lol ice ice ice LGD fan
"Ceb and Notail are players/people you need on your team in order to win Ti, or just games in general."
Fuck m feeling the hype just by watching this
Норм
Best True Sight for me!
Who hired hans zimmer for the music?
"Buti pa si Ceb, marunong mag motivate !!! pag pilipino yan napuno kana ng mura at discouragement."
Fucking CEB so fucking postive person!kudos to you sir !
"37:28 
jeraxx: -ana, you wanna relocate back to the base? memes
ana: -fuck off"
57:30 Jerax lifting the Aegis give me chills man. Well deserved J-God!
New Dota meme 41:49 😂
"I'ved already watched the whole series but when I watched it again, My bones are shivering lmao!"
Broke up with my girlfriend and somehow this vid made me happy idk why
It's so beautiful kinda feeling sad for LGD NOW they dint lose they were shattered from inside worst that a heart break
38:38 man look at the animation and the call is so memorable
Everything can work (c) n0tail
This just proves that anyone can win TI
Fuck man i was screaming like an axe 36:44 Fuckn hell
"5:30 moment

Notail: ""LMAO - OMEGALUL"""
LGD
Where is navi?
"no one deserve this most than notail, after getting betrayed by his own brothers. amazing!!"
I GOT FUCKING GOOSEBUMPS “CEEEBB” OMG
"When lgd got pressured bcs they want to win TI so badly, OG play like what they always do, no pressure. Thats why they can win this TI"
看得我好难受
am i the only notice that somnus.M jinx them
Oppa Oppa Boys -Ceb
"I would said PSG.LGD are the perfect team:

-Dominating Any dpc tournament
-Had many really good players
-Freakin PSG Football team on theirs back

But any perfection, lose to a single luck..."
"Me:hey dude are you a gamer? 
the guy:ummmmm yeah
me:what game do you play
the guy:Mobile Legends
me:hahahaha go die"
"Before i watch this true sight ,i really want lgd win.but after i see lgd player talk big and underestimated og,i glad to had og as champion ."
1:01:14 Kimihime ngapain tuh
is it me or does the first 15 sec of this videos sounds like the soundtrack from 'Man of Steel'?!!??!
Why no True Sight for Kuro?! :((
28:07 and the rest is history.
"LGD前期优势没打到最后，被翻盘，大意了，不然3-1带走了OG!!!!
 但是OG的太他妈能抗压了，这种局居然还能翻，还是TI!!! OG 牛逼，LGD牛逼！！ 重庆MAJOR见!!"
Topson is Godsend
i hope fly watch this
wow this one is 1 hour long
"Best documentary ever!! Thumbs up 👍 you know what, I’m gonna give you guys four thumbs up 👍👍👍👍"

Damn ninjas cutting onions
"and those OGfangays says OG dont want participate another tournament cause their are millionaire arw fcking idiot , go listen their conversation in game 5 moron"
WOW! JUST... WOW!!! ALL ZE FEELS!
@37:31 meme review
ANA is dabest
"BO5:
LGD: Counter their heroes, find out which heroes are good laning against their opponent. 
OG: Let's just play whatever the fuck we want!! 

Look at the difference in mindset in strategizing their game."
38:49 CEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB!!!!
"Beautiful. Heartfelt editing and tbh, I felt the joy of watching OG winning but at the same time, after watching LGD faces after losing the game really just make me felt really bad for them.
 
Btw, really like the animation for each iconic team fights in the vid ❤️️❤️️❤️️"
OG play for fun with friend but LGD .... look like they play for business.
"EPIC!!! Chillz the whole way through, watched it live in game, and on twitch, OG FTW! <3"
"so excellent, love the animated sections for the big playz"
Wonderful!!!
it's like de javu for me..almost in all aspect( kiev major )
first time seeing bigDaddy smoking Kappa XD
"28:08 ""you gonna see some shit man""....the best performance axe ever"
So many inspiration form that video
The power of this shit 🌻 is real
Ceb!!!!!! You are a true leader!!!👍🏼🙌🏻🙌🏻
"after watching this,  i will play some dota with my brother again :)"
"Somnus really talk much on early game, and never talk again after losing game 4 Lol"
AT LAST!!!!!!!!!!!
"It's interesting to see how OG uses the drafting phase to actually think of strategies in contrast to LGD who mostly looks across to the OG booth to look at how OG is ""gesturing"" to them. Maybe it's just how this episode of true sight is edited, but that's my observation."
38:45 CEEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBBB
Cuando acabo la peli .. no sabia si llorar... por pena o por felicidad ... lo unico que dire.... Gracias DOTA ...
Anna ur so fucking good man
Ceb the god!
im getting interstellar vibe from the soundtrack
where is that ana dodge on echo slam game 5
"The best final ever, yet the worst editing ever. All of the major plays were horribly shown, with close zoom in and cut into the movie bs on the very best moments. Shame, shame, shame."
"OG's Calculation For Ti: 
Ana + Spectre = Win"
I cant find the interview of notail at manila major? where i can find that? the last minutes
"42:50 Notail : You guys realize  i hit 15,000 hours of dota during this final..whatever they have i have more than them..

fuck this give me goosebump"
Thanks Valve. For everything.
The winners cried more than the ones who lost. This is true competition. Congrats OG!
"Bueno, me dio noatalgia :v"
Somnus' cocky face got fucken' erased lol
"14:45 ""Kunkka"" - (Somnus`M, TI8)"
I feel intense and nervous while im watching this even og claim already the aegis hahaha
Over Confidence will lead you downfall
Comeback king vs the late gamerrsss
"""strongly i believe when i wake up in the  morning and play ti i will play the best dota of my life""
This word really deep. Hall of fame for og."
35:59 ana's PL is more scary than the conjuring shit tbh
Ceb is a great leader.
F I N A L L Y !
"the cinematic scene tho🔥
with the ceb axe call was amazing"
please give sounds from this video!
What the coach Chinese lacks is motivation of their player. They only care for win and not to have fun. That the reason why they lose.  They not like OG coach PMA ( Positive mental attitude)
"The whole time, Ceb's wisdom to me seemed to be what helped OG take the grand finals. He really knew how to coordinate the guys when things get hectic. It really showed how critical he was for OG to take it.

Kudos to LGD, OG, they played amazing. And props to Valve, this was an extremely well done documentary and even though I saw it live, I still had chills with how they produced it all."
"ради этой пустышки 5 месяцев ждали????? я думал там будет про og как они с опенквал дошли до чемпионства про негатив с командой eg итд а не один лишь гранд финал, да эту хуйню валв могли смонтировать и на след неделе уже выложмить а не томить 5 ебучих месяцев"
"Good job Notail
You did it...You guys fucking did it
Hope the soon will be back of Ana, play against with OG"
OG !!!
17:42 ''no smoking'' my daddy just smoked straight up
7fckngMad inspired me a lot. Thanks man. I cry :')
Waiting for this. Woooaaah
"7fckngMad is the professor from la casa del papel and you can't just mess with the professor. He is always one step ahead of you. He has better management and motivational skills than most of the top companies CEO's. BTW, i have 9k hour on dota 2 only and still on 3k mmr."
1:00:05
best TI for me
that moment when Big Daddy realizes he did not win it with his ex best friend FLY - 56:12
PL 25 guys
morph have skadi and butterfly that wuld be easy
Ana with the coolest style
52:14 wtf is that a girl? HOLY SHIT HAIRS!!!
59:40 Think positive. You will get what you want.
"LGD Fans: Go Home OG!
OG: Yeah, we will... but not without $11m and the Aegis 🤪"
These guys are fucking warriors.
damn they got hans zimmer in for the soundtrack?
I realy like it
Where's RTZ?
I WANNA LEARN FRENCH RIGHT NOW
"anyone else notice at [34:10] Play to Win vs Play to Not lose mindset here. 

PLAY TO WIN BABY"
Finally!
Lgd they r just saying bad word whole game
"Holy shit! That music when he has says ""They have a big problem now. PL is 25"". Goosebumps, sick editing!"
"Diskusi = ngudud 😏
Like in my team"
"This is beautiful, thanks for giving us this masterpiece :,)"
i genuinely feel bad for OG now
"Well, it is just a documentary, I know that.
Frankly, it is really stupid for Xnova to mocking Ceb. 
I did see improvements for LGD, as a LGD fan. 
Congrats to OG. Wish see you all in TI9 Shanghai!"
At least they don't said GG when they creep pushing enemy Ancient
Gg best truesight
Who's reading comments while watching? XD
chinese crying GG stil psg.lgd what a game
Proplayer ngudud
Ceb is fucking dumb
"Valve should ban chat wheel at captain mode, make dota 2 more professional"
No 11Million$ secret shop trip on true sight DansGame
"Damn! Ceb what a positive guy , that positivity kept the momentum towards victory . Other hand Ana never seen such a calm guy in e-sport"
17:39 notail smoking in no smoking area
"Although I am not a Eastern team supporter that dude FY is a god and has all my respect. Been such a consistent player throughout his career even though his team may not have been consistent, getting 2nd in his first ever TI in 2014 is a huge achievement and then gets 2nd in TI8. It may be me but he just has this clever feel to him yet backed up with very good looks."
22:13 This animation tho
9:44 China always cina
This is sick and all but we all know that we want EG vs OG truesight
"Ceb Game 4 and Ana Game 5 is change anything, Ana MVP wooooooaahhh"
"May sound a bit racist but somehow 54:32 seeing the sad faces of the chinese fans made me happy. THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR CHANTING ""GO HOME OG!"" ASSHOLES.."
And they said nice guys finish last. Where are the haters now?
That’s the way aha aha i like it... 12:25
This is some  My Hero Academia shit comeback.
LMFAO OG REALLY JUST PICKED WHATEVER THEY WANTED HAHA
TI3>TI2>TI7>TI5>TI8
54:45 try not to cry HAHAHA
"respect to lgd, still dont like them but respect"
"This is one of the best TI ever, hope the next one will be great as this."
"Teams that win game 1, always lose the finals. LMAO"
Lacking the key moment in G4 when Ana sold items to have enough gold to buyback.
Mrinding cuk
please link subt in spanish??
"""Holy crap, Ceb is holding a bunch if papers"" - lgd. Somnus"
"How to earn money fast aside from working hard
1. Your name must be Topias Taavitsainen"
the real chinese slayer.
LGD's arrogance was misplaced. LOL
06:05 that roast
2:44 when your boss check your desk on work time
Ame - No feelings
"I thought LGD were your usual cocky Chinese roster but after watching this, I really like them. Humble, funny and not spiteful. This was such a nice TI final."
"THE POWER OF BANANA!!!
Always eat Banana in break moment...Thats the Secret..LOL"
That non-stop motivation from Ceb really gave an impact to their victory.
the next level play
Why is there no scene of the Dire Top Side Shop fight in Game 5!? I was so waiting to see this man!
Jerax is such a baby
True Sight order imo: Kiev > TI8 > TI7.
Compare TrueSight TI7 this one is more excited
"2 notable things i think i saw in this video. Ana is some kind of special guy, they are not so friendly with him, on the end he does not even take to lift aegis, all other 4 did, he is on side somehow, like he is not happy with something and they are saying ok, doesent matter, just play good. Second thing is, HOW THE FUCK guy which played all 5 games as mastermind, making almost no mistakes, stays this calm when he eventually losses on end?? Fy, you are some kind of God indeed."
Axe is love . Axe is life and those animations wow
OG is the real team compared to liquid. yes liquid is good. yet they became too good to lose the essence
I didnt want any of them to lose really.Notail and fy m happy and sad at the same time really.
FUCKING SICK
nice episode
I like how confident Ceb was right from the start with his Axe.  If I had such belief in me..
KUNKKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!
Noob chinese whoooo
Can someone pls gimme list of each animation times..
Where’s the scence when ana dodge echo? 😩 Congrats again OG ❤️

LGD lost because they underestimated OG
Its so awesome ?!!!
I'm wondering what's Fly gonna feel watching this video 🤣
The Cinematic so good!!
Og vs eg truesight
"Honestly speaking, Ceb is the true captain and coach of OG."
Ceb is the hero
Damn! Psg Lgd is so cocky
38:50 ceeeeeeeeeeeeeebbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb he gets the call of his lifetime!!
"Okay , this is epic."
BEST TRUE SIGHT EPISODE BY FAR
GG lgd trashtalker whole team😂
I really feel sorry for fy. I hope he wins this year.
"Когда видишь результаты ог сейчас, становится жалко лгд, ведь эти челики на ОГ просто запрыгнули в последний вагон и выграли этот ссаный ТИ, но на самом деле, они просто помойка."
Ana : i can't even see my hero LOL

Auto like bradah!!!!!

Jerax : feet"
"I strongly believe that 
if i woke up in the morning 
and i had to play the TI final
I would play the best Dota of my life 
and that's all that would matter to me.
If i played my very best 
nothing else would matter.

"Never forgive never forget
That's deep 7: 25"
shit.... this is much more better than movies. goodjob :)
i watched 2:00 AM and woke up to watch this clip again
"Dota is not a game, its an emotion

may be try to do something about smoking in videos next ti, just an opinion"
For some reason i fell so sad for lgd
"Emotions are mixing. I feel happy when OG got Ti but the moment when i saw lgd's fan down emotion, become sad too 
Nice one"
"whatever how good u r
invoker in finals are not working"
I like how ceb was talking so much thrash in french but they didn't subtitle it lol still one of my fav player tho
"Лучший фильм за 2018, почему Оскар дают всякой срани, а не тру сайту?"
The whole true sight... We never once see Ame trash talk or even talk.
Ceb the real leader.
UNBELIEVABLE production value. Valve could make school video presentations interesting.
"watching this makes me realized how beautiful DOTA is, and makes me want to play again, DOTA! I FCKING MISS U!"
4 months of waiting for this?! So fucking worth it!!!!
That was fucking beautiful!!!!!!!
So hard to find some person with Ceb's atitude at dota or maybe in this world. Very positive person in every way.
"Still heartbroken that LGD didn't win it, they deserved it"
Sub esp Guys please..
"*Draft phase*
Fy: Fucking hell they dare to pick axe in front of the tusk king.

*After the game*
Fy: ........."

Thank you lord 😢😭😭😭😭
GO HOME OG
The best TI ever so far
"As a chinese, I'm so happy that they lost. Totally no respect for their opponent. Blaming everything on luck whenever they lose a game or claiming that opponent using cunning strats. Not to mention that they lost to retards(sha bi) where you can hear constantly in this video, how irony"
"Axe just like from the pub. I mean good Axe from the pub, crazy, swift and fearless. Money? Title? Ceb will just have fun and kill some noobs"
"Ceeeeb.... such an inspiration, keeping his cool not only when times are rough but also when things are going well so the team doesn't get in over their heads"

"So many hates for PSG.LGD, i think that LGD making so many small mistakes that lead to big chance for OG to turn around the game. Example : Ame TPing without vision to bot shrine

Anyone remember TI7 when this team almost never lose on group phase? I just hope TI9 will be theirs. Srsly fy deserved it, that snowball save is amazing no wonder hes called fy god

Saying chinese team emotionless or robotic. Judging a player's personality by watching 60min video. Maybe theyre just being shy in front of the camera except fy, maybe, and his coach. Btw fy is so fckng cool"
"29:40

Topson: Oh my god . . .
Ceb: No worries Topias, they're strong, we're gonna fuck 'em, don't worry about it.

It's like the lil bro got bullied and the big bro swore revenge and fucked everyone that bullied his baby bro. Fucking Ceb just how confident and sexy can you be man? Lmao."

Anyone know the story of this? Ceb do analysis himself. Friend told me it was some guy named Pyro?"
Huh why need to mute???
"55:36 *i'm in a party, i'm surrounded by people. But still, i feel lonely*"
"I want to see OG when I meet the EG team, that match is the best in TI in my opinion."

10:01 found pewdiepie
I cried at the end. Time to buy more treasures. Long live dota
"Just like any other sport it's a team play, that's why Dota 2 deserves to be in Olympic Games ❤"
PSG LGD are cocky
Go home OG?? more like GO home LDG
"This is why i love Game, we can enjoy it. Sometimes we happy because win, sometimes we cry because lost. Game is not only Game, but Life. We think Game is our Life. Congrats to OG."
Those Chinese faces during game 4.....omegalul....hahahahha
"Lets mute them

Wait how we gonna know if they call gg"
"""Go home OG"" careful what you wish for... OG come back home with Aegis of champion 😂

that notail shoulder hurt because of crit? lol
"28:07 ""you gonna see some shit man ""-ceb

Ceb could be a TED speaker if he wanted to xD dayum
Fy and xNova PepeHands.
So much chinese salt at game 4.
CEB gets the call of his lifetime
Vavle just already make a Dota heroes movie like these cinematics

El problema de los chinos que en las rectas finales se nerviosean mucho y en vez de ponerse calmados y disfrutar el juego se ofuscan ... Esto es normal porque en China esto no se lo toman solo como un juego
Love from indonesia !
(GO HOME OG) *take the aegis and go home*
"LGD are being so cocky, overconfident and arrogant. Glad OG snapped the pattern."
I want a friend like Ceb. always supportive and not blaming others but learn from the mistake and do better next time. He is the man of OG besides notail.
hell yeah finally🔥
The animation is good but actual footage is better
You know its done when u see jerax smiles
"lmao ""LETS MUTE THEM"" ahahahahahahaha"
Goosebumps all over me. Whoooa

"Good true sight ,  but imo true sight major was the best"
SOMNUS so funny while losing LOL
"but where is Ana's eul echo dodge and the ""confident level over 9000"" talk right before the 5th game :("
"Translate pls.. i don't understand. 
Putang Ina mo pignoy means?"
22:15 why they didnt make animation like this on ti7
In Ceb we trust
feels so good to watch the chinese face when lgd lose
59:47
This is a freaking great production. We can feel all the emotions. The image of Ana's PL on high ground at 36:00 gives me chill.
THE POWER OF HARD WORK AND THE SUNFLOWER BOYS
"24:06 - [Fan] You got this, the next one and then the next one!"

OG really have a good positive attitudes, yes they worth winning"
"I almost cried during the winning end game moment by notail, He is about to cry and holding it but burst out when their team was called as the TI8 champion. What a legendary team if ana is still on OG."
1 hour of pure art <3
Eg kicks rtz.. He joins with some other team which has no ti winners and my boy will win.. 2019
Chinese audience reactions are gold 😂😂😂
"The Best Story of TI

"Still waiting for SEA team to win TI. Next year maybe?

Fnatic have a chance with the recent line up actually. They got 1 of the best offlaner in the world, ice3x, two world class supports, reliable carries, and more importantly, no EE."
"В следующем году Виртус Про будет в выпуске, скриньте"
Damn im crying ;-;
"what i like about ceb is, he support what heroes his teammates want to pick."
SingSing is the real Tusk King.

Lgd really underestimated og and that's why they lost
*one last ride*
34:54 onwards best 5-10 minutes ..
what does somnus keep snacking on from a pill bottle?
Ceb can be a motivational speaker. Lolx
LGD wasn't as positive in attitude as OG was. Just shows how important it is to be mentally ready and having a good attitude.
"no Aquila sold to buyback, no Eul dodge .   .   ."
This is the best True Sight episode ever!
Bring back open AI HAHAHA

Ceb is my favorite
great video!
Top 10 anime of the year
This movie left bad taste on my lips
Ana Good play ember..  MVP.

The video quality is so 👌
Unleash the Ana!!!

"31:00 Ceb and Jerax laugh. XD
39:13 Glad Ana is still human like us. XD

Ceb is so amazing"
I want Ana to be my boyfriend. He is humble and adorable.
OG
Where is the part when ame talks? Lmao
CNDOTA BEST DOTA
"damn i really hate the feeling of losing too, i relate to LGD so much when we joined like a local tournament and my team lost, we were pretty much all having cold emotions after the game..."
Ceb is like the oxygen for this team!!
"LGD: says literally 2 syllables

captions: 2 paragraphs"
"22:10 - 22:23 
Where i can watch this moviee 😭😭😭"
where is boom id?
Ceb's leadership and mind for DOTA strategy making is so fucking unreal.
38:40 beautiful
It's like watching anime
Man.... PSG.LGD player are so toxic. I'm a Chinese and i know that some of the subtitle was set to lighten up what they saying. The true word they say is actually more brutal and unforgivable.
It took them 5 months to make it.
"Wow, LG are arrogants"
this is waaaaaayy better than youtube rewind
Feelsbadman
Ceb is greatest motivatorrreee 😆😆😆
The such emotional
55:36 Gamer New Years Eve be like...
AME didnt say a word
SO FUCKING GOODSHIT MAN!!!!!!!
No ana no party (bucharest minor)
[4:15] Outcome Independence...
"This truly has made me regain confidence on myself, for the past 5 years I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. All I knew this whole time  is that I wanted to play Dota and nothing else. But as time went on I just lost all focus, even dropping the game since 2014. Now 5 years later OG have made me recover the fuel I once had. I used to play on 4.5k bracket eventually reaching 5k but no more than that. I was so frustated with myself that I ended up dropping everything,from dota, from studies, even dropping the selfsteem I had and it's been like that for the past 5 years. Last year however after watching the same guy that motivated me to play meepo and micro intensive heroes win TI after all these years it felt like a call from destiny a call to try my best again. I might not be on my best form yet,as I got calibrated into archon IV a far cry from what it used to be. But be sure to pin this one valve, I'm coming,I can feel the fuel I once had inside me doesn't matter how, it doens't matter if I have to sleep 4 hours a day between work and play I'll be there in Shangai this year and even if I don't I can sure as hell be confident enough to say that I tried my  best."
Finally here uhhhhh nice
41:42 GabeN working as crowd control.
CEB is a father for OG
"6:33 Somnus: Holy crap, Ceb is holding a bunch of papers. I LoL'd pretty hard :)))"
Beautiful ending. Notail worked so hard and was so patient losing his friend.
"YOU CRY, IM NOT. IM NOT CRYING SORRY FOR THAT. :')"

"HAHAHAHA Pl 25 guys
Badass ana PL"
"i feel bad for FY.. he's the one giving LGD a postive attitude, cheering them up.. like in game5 rosh fight he said "" it's ok they committed buyback to get the aegis"""
"This is Very good man, but This is more better if in the last game you show the ANA'S JUKE when Fy is ECHO SLAMing Him"
OG可能是最有戏剧性的一个TI冠军，从中立的角度，TI8是很经典的一届，很多故事可以回顾，恭喜他们。但最后还是要说：TI9是中国的！
China crowd and player were being too cocky and disrespectful... Deserve to lose
Og deserve that shit game
"It's fucking insane that everyone after TI8 pointed at Ceb's axe and how he almost singlehandedly won that game for OG, but holy shit we still aren't giving this dude the credit he deserves like having been the coach through 4 major wins he turned it into something on the main stage in the pod. What a fucking legend, honestly."
"Нет фильма документальнее на свете, чем true sight от valve corporations"

"Fy : i'll mute them once we're in game ....wait, what if they call GG and we miss it? 
XNova : then you just wait for the throne to explode.    this line is killing me!!"
Topshit being carried all 5 games. He does not have a good game
Massive respect for that positive thinking

"Even though OG is my team, I'm not saying this out of bias - but TI8 was honestly the best TI Final i've ever witnessed after TI3"
One hour of drama

"They won because of the Filipino's,  because of Manila major hahaha"
"Even though I knew the outcome of the match, I watched the entire hour of the video on one breath, sometimes a tear fell  like baby. Either this work was done on this True Sight, or 8 int was a success"
Ceb's words are so damn powerful
Where is the champagne 🍾 🍾??
Anyone know what was CEB saying in 31:00 ?
Did NoTail just made fun of the Chinese Language 17:24 !?? Racist. BAN NoTail from all Dota2 events please!!!
55:13 the face of someone being nervous thinking that he is very near of his goal 😁
"""which shoulder is it, man?""

They didn't include the dodged echo slam by Ember Spirit :(
"I just want a 7ckingMad Ceb in my life! Imagine when you play with him, doesn't matter if you lose. Just fucking enjoy the game."
"!!!!"""" PL LEVEL 25  GUYS """" !!!!"
"OG= Passion

"Fckn ceeeeeebbbbbbbb call , i love it man !!!"
I got gossebumps
"the arrogance of chinese team, good thing they lost , while OG positivity and trust on teammates made them win ..ceb goat"
feels bad tho for fy :(
"51:44 Ame say something.
""Wait 20 seconds for my BKB"""
"The mental between LGD and OG is soo dm different, OG really enjoy their game with positive attitude and fun while LGD really under pressure and seems not enjoy their game. 

The quotes is ""when you ready to lose, you are ready to take the biggest step with your team"""
52:14  you're welcome
Why are there waters spilling in my eyes?
"12:43 Team that win Game 1 always lose the finals.
ME : hurmmm. NOPE. Not this time"
"At this day , notail already a legend of dota2"
That Go Home OG chants! Hahaha. Sad chinese.😂

"oof the ""GO HOME OG"".. XD"
"we can look how different the team works, 1 team as friend, 1 team as company, the darkside of china doto"
"CEB GONNA FUCK THEM ,ACTUALLY DID!"
THE BEST FUCKING TI EVER
Axe > Tusk. Those axe plays giving me some cringy feeling.

BLOCK THE USER !! IF YOU PLAY IN SEA
36:00 That PL...... look
49:50 game so intense bigdaddy became morty for a sec
the name bigdaddy comes up just because ana need him
"This was just like the kiev major 😭 they were down 1-2 against VP but made it 2-2 and then final game came VP was so ahead of OG in terms of gold and exp but OG remained calm and ANA also asked ""who has a better late game"" same response from notail OMG I'm a big fan since Manila Major, it was the time I started playing dota and Manila Major was my first live event and witnessed OG win it all and now TI I'm just so happy for them"
strongest ti best ti ever?
"""Mute them""  wahahahaha..."

"Team that win on game 1, lose the finals.

-Psg LGD"
"""Arrogance Vs Motivation"" TI8 Final Summary"
"Nothing beats ""free to play"""
"Please, someone write all phases that Себ said in france."
chinese and eg fan disliked the video
Fcking insane.
"heck, different between chinese teams and rest of the world teams, they blamed each other for mistakes, instead of supporting and giving positive feedbacks, they also underestimates their opponent so much at each draft picks. i mean i cant really blame them for having those mentality, as its always china against the world. but they really need to change that mindset if they want to win more ti. This year, the TI will be held in china, hope to see better sporting china teams. no more drama"
I smoked in every game.. Notail be like.
"I dont know why, but OG very very pma"
The cinematic is so good!
Im crying
#UNBAN #SMASH
Win together lose together. Wow.
Give this man Ceb a medal for his positivity and morale boost.. Awesome!!

2 side of the ti8
"Crowd : MGA BOBO!
54:32"
Where is the moment when the ana's eul to save 11.000.000 dollar? It was really hype
OG красавцы
Go home LGD mga hing hong
This film is so fucking good!!!!
"Humility is the key. arrogance and 
underestimating opponents will lead you to defeat.
 Great job OG."
"PSG : team who wins game 1 lose the final


TI7 Liquid win 3-0 against Newbee...


Nice encouraging but..."
Just laughing at how pissed Somnus is.
Masih kalah viewnya sama video jess no limit ckckck
"17:40 : No smoke sight

FUCK OG
Best 1 hour of my life🖤 Congrats OG from Indonesia🇮🇩
MAY GANTO BA ML NYO????
The animation damn. Goosebumps 😶
High ego chinese bois.
FLY has WALKed out.
This movie gives me goosebump that axe cinamtic keeps me shouting
"China slayers, fuck yeah!"
38:55 the real coach gameplay
CEB is the real MVP!
"I don't know why I'm crying when I look at it. It feels like I won this TI, the most epic and emotional TI in history, thanks OG for that"
Love the animation
52:14 самый эпичный момент
Feels bad for Fy God man. WP ceb for keeping the team's high moral.
let us mute all of them :D
"They all look like singsing. Bald singsing, emo singsing, singsing with glasses, singsing singsing"
"Man, when your coach is your team leader, keeping everyone together. Well done Ceb, and to the rest of OG. Totally deserved and got me hyped for this year's TI."
Holy shit this videos make me goosebumbs all the times
Never forgive never forget
PSG was so tilted after game 4 lol
Idiot china haha
"CEB, THE PROPHET"
OG picks PL. This is how mafia works!
Это лучший час в МОЕЙ ЖИЗНИ

12:42 *TEAMS THAT WIN GAME 1 ALWAYS LOSE THE FINALS* Liquid : Am I Joke to U ?
jesus
"masterpiece. intense final.
bulldog: fuck off LoL"
we know the ending of this match. but true sight. is really TRUE SIGHT.
"""Mute them!"" *LMFAO*"
"this Jerax and Ana always make me laugh everytime they show up LOL

best quote "" PL Level 25 guys "" XD
Nice TrueSight"
"Before the finals i told all my friends: 
If LGD wins I will be very happy for a while, but then i will  be sorrow as time goes by.
If OG wins i will be really sad for a while, but I will be delight eventually, as a legend witnessed in the game I truly loved."
Go home LGD
25:26 well he did jinx it
"rigged TI/ easiest TI. no way this shitt team wins TI. They purposely set it up so that OG could make it to the finals vs a Chinese team. They wanted to feed off the drama of Fly leaving Notail for a better team. ""WAHHH my best friend left me wahhhhhh"" oh shutt the fuck up. He left because your team sucked. Valve fed off that drama to create an OG victory and break the chinese even year cycle. Pretty embarrassing when you get caught rigging a TI. NO ONE other than disgusting virgin euros think that was a real TI grand finals. GN GN"
58:50 when you Lakad Matatag your way to the Aegis
china  numba two
OG NO.1!!!
"Got caught that Notail was smoking at 'No Smoking' area.. 😂😂 Btw, love OG!!"
From OG OMEGALUL to OG PagChomp
"i feel so fucking happy for notail, all his life he wanted to be the very best version of himself playing DotA. he dreamt big and always dreamt big, and in the end he got what he always longed for. I still want to congratulate OG on their win. chemistry and teamwork on point hundred fucking percent."
"""Mute them"". Best advice ever."
Ceb's Axe game on game 4 was absolutely amazing
KEREEEEEEEEN BGT ANJINGGGGGGGGGGGG
2:46 watcha doin there ana :D

#Dreamgreen
"Why this true sight only 1 hour, This video should 2 hour, :("
"the ""CEEEEEEEBBBB"" moment"
"that shot of fy and somnus' faces as the fireworks go off, holy shit"
10:26 Singsing PogChamp
There's my dog at 7:30 :) Ha!
So LGD is more arrogant than VP.
Fucking goosebumps bro
"Not really like like lgd frm this true sight , they are over confident and so rude . Disappointing"
THe cinematics
"35:58 When you get home late, and your mom is waiting for you to walk in"
"Everytime ana speak, I know it's a little bit crude, but I got a boner...

is that normal?"
When you love both the teams and can't choose xD. Also Notails smile can stop wars xD.
Girls in 37:24 😍🤗 haha
"Team who win the game 1 lose the finals. -LGD

"Where is the echo slam dodge react :( ,"
"this is why OG win the games, they're very positive 😍

Mantapppp!!"
BEST OF TRUE SIGHTS
"they should have added the aquilla sell of ana in the secret shop so he can have buyback, its save the game you know, and very important highlight on that game too.. without that buyback they might not have the game 5 and aegis because that gank on him settled the game and they lose.."
"Ceb's uplifting spirit, BigdaddyN0tail's passion, Ana's raw talent, Topson's perseverance and if you combined all four traits then you get JeraX."
"""Dota is a sick mental game. It brings out the best and worst in you. It comes down to half a second, where you just can't predict what's gonna happen. You try to look at everything as pieces and points, you try to look at it as simply the game. Who ended up winning the mental warfare always win the series. That's how you're going to win the tournament. If you break the other mind, it gets really easy. Some minds are really hard to beat, though.""

- Johan ""N0tail"" Sundstein"
29:49 don't let the girl down <3
Hypeee
Best true sight yet
Lucky they dont fight Liquid and virtus pro :)
"SPOILER ALERT!!!!

Suddenly.. Everyone are OG fan's! you guys are fake profiles

"When F7ckingmad said ""This is my game boys.""."
Ceb is really a good motivator.
I don't like chinese teams but I want FY to win TI
Im actually crying right now. The added animation carried me away. The best true sight i've ever seen! The long wait is not bad at all! Valve did it!
a lot of fucks in this video
"Ceb holding to much paper
No one ever done tht!!!!!!"
Where the euls?
OG really deserved their ti. Fans watching with their mouth open show the pressure for the players and come back from it. Previous Liquid line up under Kuroky was really promising and I'm glad that J-God is also a ti winner now. GL to Psg.lgd in future too!
Imagine filipinos going to the true sight finals and says  putang ina mo and bobo. It would be so much fun to watch.
Notail wanna doggy with Ceb
"This was beautiful.

Thank you valve for making this"
BEST TRUE SIGHT!!!!!!

Goosebumps all time
"55:12 i think this moment right here, it hits N0tail, i mean he was so into the game, he wasnt aware the game was actually over until
they started to hit the ancient. You can see his face, his eyes just popped at the knowledge they were doing it."
"I actually cried so much during this. For LGD, my favorite Eastern team, for OG, my favorite Western team. This was one of the most impactful films I've seen in a long time"
"I feel bad for LGD man, damn"
no after credit ???
36:05 AXE CGI with small intro
Z-z-zeus???  Hahaha
"OG's draft:
Notail: Hey guys what are you feeling?

It hurts you from inside and you never be the same as old days and sometimes it gives you the happiness that you want to Cry ... Life sucks ...
31:44 Poootaaaa!!! hahahahhaha :P :)

IDI NAHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY
"Честно, хотелось победы lgd, и не в силах дело
А в их спокойствие, не радовался победе og на том инте, но всё равно рад за них )
LGD очень жалко, но ещё вернутся )
Мучал вопрос когда смотрел всё это,  Ceb  и n0tail  геи ?)

This is when men cried. Too beautiful

"GO home OG??
yes they going home with aegis xaxaaxaxa"
"""Maybe"" nxt time"
Habis selesai game tuh ngudut biar skillnya nambah ea
Didn't know Fy and Notail smoke.
"as much as I loved watching this, it still didn't quite match up to the hype when watching the games live and seeing how close OG was to losing. there were moments in Game 4 when I was completely sure it was the end, and yet that Ceb call changed everything. Or even in Game 5, when they chose some of the most unpicked heroes in the tournament and were dying back to back early game. But that one Roshan fight completely changed it all in their favour. Valve did a great job with this True Sight, but it seems impossible to really show how incredibly well OG played, and how they truly deserve the title of Comeback Kings."
Xnova = AI bot[EASY]
so emotional
*GOOSEBUMPS*
I'll just leave it here for notail 🌻

"another TI another chinese team's dreams crushed, FeelsGoodMan the west rises strong."
I realized ceb is the captain in og
"Valve, what the heck happened with this? You've done good documentaries before but the editing on this is weird. You keep cutting away from important fights to show the crowd (a few people standing) or the player (passive face watching a screen) instead of the fight. Every. Single. Time."
We need OG vs EG true sight.
im crying fccckk!!!!! the best emotional moment! OG ! u did it !!!!

Best documentary I ever seen in esport mixed of emotions and passion from the players
Dota antagonized LGD in this one. sad
"Thank you for letting us relive one of the best games of dota ever played and showing us the passion of the best players in the world! Also, what is ryan gosling doing in the OG booth? Also, how are the chinese team such good smack talkers? They had me laughing my ass off."
Im really happy to see this. Such a great game for OG.

I got goosebumps everytime I watch this! Like this if you also having goosebumps when watching this
"犹豫了很久还是忍着痛看完了，又经历了最痛苦的一段回忆，偶数年奇迹曾经离我们那么近。第四把那么大的优势被PL活活拖死，看的很揪心，第五把多次集火火猫被风杖解围，当时的赔率变化简直是过山车....

我们输可能就输在队内气氛不如他们好吧，看视频LGD的成员缺少一个Leader去团结队友改变节奏吧。FY和May皇这届TI真的是无可指责的强，吹爆，没拿到TI冠军可能真的就差一点运气吧，TI9加油LGD！"
Bigdaddy shows us to always believe in yourself.
At the end of the movie I just got it. 7 fuckingmad your so fucking crazy man. All the time you motivated your team¡ Come on you really deserve it...

ноутейл пробил на эмоции
"we dont care about losing the war , im just gonna fuckin play ""Ceb""
whatever we pick , im trustin on you guys , we play and we slay them. 
HOLY SHIT , this team , OG , such a motivational team , they strongly believe to their teammates , no blames , just keep and keep trusting each other , like they are playing for fun dude , they really deserved it for sure , this is the best TI Grand final i ever watch it live , TI3 finals is great , but this is more dude. and after watched this , im strongly believe that this TI is the best ever. watchin OG in true sight means u got a lot of motivated. i doesnt matter how their opponents strong was, they just keep believe and trust each other. holy shit man. they are fuckin underdogs , they are fuckin big team slayer ,just remember when they facing vp on final (forgot what kind of tournaments) , they also stated as team who gonna lose in the final game. omg !"
And now OG is down without ana
they don't highlight the ana PL selling item to buyback. FeelsBadMan
Still got goosebumps

i got goosebump
i am amaze all i can say just wow!
"OG's way of communicating outside the booth and handling pressure inside the booth is just so phenomenal and enlightening. They talk casually but inside, their burning passion is serious as hell and they proved it by claiming the Ageis."
"Wanna see the faces of those in thr crowd wuo said ""Go home OG"" when OG lifted the aegis."
"damn.. Somnus or watever Maybe, he’s badass as fuck. Even his team respect him like big bro."

LGD жалко в особенности fy парень так отыгрывал. Я так сильно болел за них.

Ceb’s motivation boost OG so much that help them crown ti8 champ. Sometimes saying things that you dont know that it is true still could give your teammates hope. Well played OG

38:47 CEEEEEEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBBB
"watch in 240p for real true sight.

Yea limited internet quota guys."
I dont know.  I have my tears fall down at the end
TY Valve for this great movie. Really enjoyed it and i learned a lot watching this. Not for DotA 2 only but for life. The way they enjoy what they are doing the way they motivate themselves.. it was a great experience for me watching it the Player POV. Never underestimate an enemy and never forget to enjoy everything that comes with life.
"Its amazing. Ceb word after and before every game.. emotions, thats why we love it"
Insane series!
Thank you truesight ! For making this video
态度上就输了
What I liked about OG is they are not blaming themselves during the game. They simply point out their mistakes and they make sure that it won't happen again. I also love the fact that they are cheering themselves even though they are on a bad spot (Ceb's positivity is admirable). FY was the only one trying to motivate the team on the chinese side. :/
30:39 LAKAD MATATAGGGGGG!!!!
"Where's Axe? 
CEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBBBBBBB"
"What really impressed me,was when Ceb was playing on Axe,moment after moment he found his steam and that added a moral and even Topson who was having a bad game embraced the situation and turned on playing.Ceb leadership skill is really impressing,i would even say Ceb really did it on the last moment.The spirit of the team enhanced and they figured out that they can.Astonishing play"
"(Spoilers) 

:OG won"
"I feel like Ana is not being a full member of the team, like he is always in this awkward position where he is waiting for other member to acknowledge him. It's a shame knowing he carried so much in the games."
Valve didnt show when ana dodges the echo? Cmonn.........
1hr wtf
Omg fy is the real tusk king
Ceb is like real coach of OG
Is Ana chinese in blood? Damn! Then LGD is really good keeping it not to say that 'Ana is a traitor'
"holy shit, you've done it"
FUCKING AWESOME !!!
“Never Forgive !! Never Forget !!!”
"People will remember TI8's winner - OG. But truth be told, OG didn't play with VP, Liquid and Team Secret. If they did, I highly doubt if they could make it to the final."
Ana Muted
37:55 dreams denied
Cingcong with overconfident level and lose hahahaaha
"me celebrating newyear
55:38"
I think lgd coach is making lgd messed up...
"59:30 notail was thinking in Fly at this moment
Or maybe he can't believe that moment(win a tí)

IT BROKES MY HEART :'("
I love how they didn't translate Ceb when he played Axe :D
Finally!
"37:31
Jerax : Memes?
Ana : Fuck off.
Jerax : bye, bye."
29:07 topson typical tilt 😂
i feel play like kuroky now XD
38:39 best part!!
HOHOHOHOHO ♥
"Lgd cant predict og's line upcoz og itself dont even know what they pick, They just ask their mate ""what u want to play? """
ceb had such a perfect read of them...... wow
55:52 so sad for my boy FY 😥😥😥 got 7-0 stats with ES but lost in the last game as well as the most important game of the series and mb of his career.
i love those animations so much ... wish they made a whole series of dota
i wanna go to top 100 world and search team for ti11

"This years' true sight, so damn good. WP to both teams."
omfg at last
lgd加油！
wow just wow
my ultrawide monitor loved this video :)
Gaben please True sight OG vs EG..
"With Ceb's lead, OG gave all their best as the crowd haven't expected from Game 3. While the rest of the LGD's emotions are about to flow out, at 55:13 we could really see it Notail's face that he's having a very heavy sigh packed with all the emotions, upon realizing that he's about to experience the best day of his life, proving what he said in the Manila Majors 2016. What a historical game, best TI. Though, best True Sight."
Ахуенно.спасибо поплакал!
The best documentary I've ever seen in my life.

"Damn, I can feel the emotions the both of the team, espically Papa Fy and Cebbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb who always cheer up their teams!"
"Jerax : Anna tell me if u get ruptured so i wont relo u out 
Anna : Sure, Idk what the fucking is going on, can't even see my own hero"
At least u could feel a better team vibe in LGD unlike Newbee it was a constant tension all the finals
55:36 mood
"gimana mau menang setim mukanya misuh misuh ngono wkwkwkwk.....

ngopi lah lur.. ben ga sepaneng"

"Если в прошлом году я думал что Куро спокойнее камня в финале,то на этом инте безхвостый его сделал,по его лицу можно на 100% было сказать что он знал что победит
А уж про себа на аксе я просто молчу
П.с. но трусайт скучный в этом году,просто показали последние 5 карт и все"
Worth the fucking wait.
Confidence oozing in just one video
Where tifanny? Og managers? She's out? Never see her..
LAKAD MATATAAG
"Ceb's confidence in playing Axe is out of this world man.. 

He's like ""this is my game boys"" 

And yep he proved it CEEEEEEEEEBBB"
Ok this recharged me from a heartbreak *feelsgoodman*
Best TI so far. Best True Sight so damn far.

"I can't quit Dota2 because of some moment like this, hand down for OG"
this video is making me nervous!
"These people are an inspiration to me and maybe even a hero. They had all the misfortunes happen to them: OG wasnt doing well 90% of 2018, Fly and S4 left them, they had to play qualifiers with a completely new roster. Honestly man,  I have so much respect for these guys!"

You got to pee
"Thats what you deserve and get when you disrespect the oponent. Somnus and Chalice threw lots of trashtalk to OG. They deserved this, call it karma!"
Where’s the euls play on ana?
i like how those chinese were so focusing on winning without enjoying the game while on the contrary OG really enjoyed the game.
"i dont think anybody notice why ceb was questioning n0tail. ""is it this one"" while rubbing/massaging his shoulder. i think it was when crit bump on his shoulder"
min 8:49 they have them muted to all of OG
"Best TI ever








I speak about TI3 of course."
"4:42

OD PIXEL is so underrated
YA BOYS
"The strongest is not the one who doesnt fall,its the one who keeps getting up after he fell down.This phrase explains the situation between these teams.OG always does combacks after combacks bcz of this,but on another hand like newbee lgd keeps reminding old mistakes while new game or while pause between games.They also understimated their enemies and always left a place for Og to make a play .Thats all made up  a big reason why OG WON."
who would else watch a full movie from only the cinematic cuts they just showed (EPIC)
The Axe's edge is keen again.
No twitch chat reactions FeelsWeirdMan

"I literally screamed Allahu Akbar when OG makes great plays against LGD, especially earthshaker saves for grand final and Ceb saving Ana. And also Ana's Ember Spirit survives Arcane Curse back to the tp despite those many spells he used. And also great buyback and get triple kill on roshan perimeters"

"Where is Notail's GF? I haven't seen her. HAHAHA

No GF = TI8 Champs!"
The most awaited..
"Вот это я понимаю продакшн. Фильмы от вэлв не перестают удивлять и пробивать на эмоции, очень хорошо что они продолжают радовать нас контентом, не забывают хотя бы на человеческом уровне, показано всё, от начала до конца, шикарные синематики, от которых мурашки по коже, и само собой поднятие аегиса как нечто особенное, заставляет испытать радость и разделять эмоции с теми, кто его поднял, хоть и на экране. Ещё раз спасибо, вэлв."
Ceb should start a career as a motivator mann...
NOTAIL U THE BEST👍

"I´ve hit 15000 hours the last game. 15000. However much they have, i have more. Haha"
