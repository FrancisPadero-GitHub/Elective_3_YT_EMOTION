Everyone on this squad deserves credit, Ana for coming back, Ceb as the leader, NoTail as the heart, Topson for coming out of nowhere, but Jerax's biggest contribution is so modest that it's actually easy to overlook, but it's arguably the greatest of them all. He stayed, even when he didn't have to.
I think it's easy hindsight to brush off given what came afterwards, but S4 and Fly left OG for dead and that was the universal consensus going into TI, no one even gave them a chance. Unlike Ceb and NoTail, Jerax was still a valuable commodity that good teams would have made room for to compete for TI, he had options, and no one would have faulted him for leaving an already cooked team like they do Fly and S4, but he didn't do that. 
It's truly poetic, like the polar opposite of Fly in every way. Jerax could have left to chase TI without giving up anything, but chose to stay, while Fly gave up everything to leave and came up short.",@localneo-graphic4647,UC2jLqJ41FcgwKg2TfmAwv4Q,2025-05-22T19:03:18Z,2025-05-22T19:03:18Z,0,0

Fly and S4 have been cursed for it. Cr1t shoulder tackled and got cursed. Nikobaby 6v5 cursed. TorontoTokyo saying ez game, gets kicked by Spirit, and they became 2x TI winners without him. Secret beefed with Ceb in 2020 and now they are struggling. With every ups, there comes with downs. The lineup after TI10 was doing well at first until they got hit with the visa problem and never really recovered from it. The OG magic continued with the substituding but it didn't last long. Sure, OG in 2023 was painful to watch, but this 2024 lineup is doing wonders and ending games super fast so far. Ceb as a monster pos 5 is really amazing. Plus alot of OG agents have been planted, currently Topson and MC destroying Tundra from the inside, Miracle, iLtW, Ammar and Sumail for Nigma, Midone in Secret, DM Entity, Ana for a short while in RNG, Liquid and T1, JerAx was in the EG bulba era, Taiga in Wildcard and Bleed, and Moonmeander  awaiting to being planted in the next team.

Maybe because it sounds mean to say it, but we all know what it is. 

First of, the fans were like ""GO HOME OG"" and then the next game they're like all heartbroken üòÖ freaking love those scenes. Second, PSG.LGD themselves. Overconfident, smug, arrogant, then boom--lost TI8 üòÖ They underestimated OG BIG TIME and they only went sweating when they were pushed to game 5. I gotta say they deserve the loss because of it. Finally, I can't help but notice how Fy was the most ""serious"" among them. At least from this video, he didn't seem to trashtalk OG and be arrogant that much like Chalice and Somnus. Out ot all of them, it's Chalice who was super arrogant and overconfident. I mean at 50:23, he went on to charge into OG thinking they were feeding, only to *lead the charge to their team getting whooped* . After the battle, Chalice goes on to blame the team for not having TPs. Like dude, you underestimated the enemy. It was you who decided to rush in, and now you're blaming your team? OG wasn't feeding, it was you who fed your team to the enemy üòÖ 

And sadly, I noticed Fy seemed to have been annoyed by Chalice's remark. I think he too felt that Chalice was the one at fault and was being a bad teammate for blaming the team for his idiotic mistake. It's true that Fy's unfortunately being led away from the Aegis, and maybe it's also because of teammates like Chalice, and their overall attitude of underestimating the enemy. It's like Fy is in NoTail's shoes but worse. To their credit, PSG.LGD was too proud--too proud to even call GG and watched their Ancient explode.",@Gallade400,UCb2tgNZMd4WFvF0MF2VLrIQ,2023-12-22T12:05:57Z,2024-05-27T07:38:06Z,0,0

Easily one of the greatest moments not just in Dota history, but in sporting history in general, the kind that inspires players and athletes no matter what they compete in. 

But even those competitors were and still are fans first and foremost. And what do fans want? A triumph of the heart, one where their hopes and prayers are seemingly magically answered.

UgytePKPDoVBp2r0TlV4AaABAg,"On my annual rewatching, today's reflection is that in any competition, if there's a winner, there's also a loser.  Don't get so caught up in your winning, or your team's winning, that you forget the folks on the other side.  It makes me wish major tournaments like this would make more space to include the second-place and runners-up in the celebrations, instead of largely relegating them to consolation prizes (of a few million dollars...)  Like, even if you lose the finals, being second-best team in the entire world out of 18 teams that placed and countless teams that competed in group stages and Majors is still an incredible accomplishment and deserves praise, too.",@dc8836,UCVEGcMjPZL5udYFcz-9QAXw,2022-10-14T06:18:38Z,2022-10-14T06:18:38Z,3,0

They're not there for the game, but to get a small win after being beaten down in life. As a teammate, either you give them the in-game one-sided abusive win they came for or become a free online psychiatrist for them to unload on.  Losers like these stops at nothing to get the win they came for, one way. Or another. You're playing a different game than what you were playing when you're a teenager.

Gotta give big props to the video editors and the commentators that make the videos way more enjoyable!

I also don't want this True Sight to give the impression that LGD or Chinese teams don't know how to cheer each other up or that they only point fingers at each other. There are very little moments in this clip that include the LGD conversation with each other in their supportive moments. They won't be there in the final if they are not trusting/helping of each other. There are many things we branded badly to Chinese players/fans which I think is unwarranted. The only thing that I really wish they do more is giving the opponent a deserving cheer/applause.

UgzeIy6k9TSvAs79myl4AaABAg,"Skillwise, OG was weaker than LGD.
On ti8 LGD were just on another level of skill and understanding of the game. They were exceptionally good in nearly every aspect of this patch. They were the first one to completely destroy the broken alchemist at the time, and the personal skill of every player was just insane. However, the raw-talent and pure skill is not everything that takes from you to win the game, OG were stronger mentally, they had nothing to lose. Yes, OG played worse than LGD overall, but when it truly matters OG didn't falter. LGD had those expectations that made them weaker in the most deciding moments. You can see, when OG counterplay them - how much does LGD players talk out of frustration compared to OG, when OG are losing, they don't allow themselves to get distracted out of the frustration, they kept focus. In this I wanted to point out Topson, as he had the roughest time of them all - he has been quite frequently dumpstered on mid by Maybe, but even in the most shit game, Topson kept his focus and continued playing the game unbothered with all he got(and left from destroyed mid xd). But to be honest, it's not really fair to point praise a single person from OG, they all were insanely good in their attitude and focus. 

This is kinda reminding me of One Piece's Luffy vs. Katakuri, when Katakuri was stronger, had superior fruit, had stronger haki, was just physically stronger in every aspect compared to Luffy, but Luffy still managed to take him out despite of all of the factors.",@dd-zq7rp,UCePOwEnmmGCvGqZxd2xbezQ,2021-02-11T14:22:22Z,2021-02-11T14:22:57Z,0,0

So i mind you this was the 6th night of all in tryhard drinking and partying so people where already kinda tired. So around 10 of us sat down in front of a screen so little we barely could see and you can imagine the internet there wouldn't allow us to watch it in a 1060p resolution, so it kinda resembled those old tales where families gathered together to a little shitty radio or tv to watch the football matches, but it was all worth it. In the end most of the people felt too tired so they had to go to sleep, so i was watching the finals with a guy who had little to no idea what was going on (he had like 150 h of dota) and a girl who didn't know shit about the game, so i kept explaining the main things what was happening, but everyone there felt that something magnificent was going on. I can still clearly remember the hype of that axe call or that last 20 of them hitting the throne we all jumped up in the end with goosebumps all over.

And TI9 is the stage you reach when all that support for each other pays off and you learn to trust and believe in yourself. From the group stages to the grand finals, they ABSOLUTELY STOMPED everybody, and even though they lost a game or two, IN NO SINGLE GAME were they completely dominated.

How LGD knows they are losing, but they know they have to fight, even though they doubt they'll win hits me harder then it should, especially when the music plays from 54:20. From the sight of the LGD fans knowing that they won't win TI this year, then showing fy, their captain, not knowing what to do or say to save his team.

54:46 and onward is especially really dramatic. When Chalice dies, it cuts to him. When Somnus dies, it cuts to him. When xNova dies, it cuts to him. The players at that time realizes that they come all this way, only to lose at the final game of the tournament. Knowing how Chinese people's mentality works, that's still devastating.

Ugz-ohF1bF8sX_GIGmt4AaABAg,"In my opinion, whatever sport you play, if you have enough skill and motivation, the mentality that OG showed here is the only thing that will make the difference :

1 - They play for the pleasure
2 - They have full and sincere respect and trust towards each others

It's so rare and so complicated to manage to release the pressure and yet keeping somewhere in mind that you have to give your best.

To me the best moments of this video are a lot around Ceb, but if the rest of the team wasn't embrassing his attitude, it wouldn't be the same :

1 - Ceb positive and yet very aggressive attitude.
2 - Their fake ( ofc they prepared to get in troubles but it's never simple to manage once you're in it ) coolness when they're in a bad situation
The perfect example of the Ceb attitude effect is when Topson is getting harassed, he's like "" fuck I'm losing it "" but his brain is never telling him "" your team hates you "", nope, his brain is telling him "" don't worry, your team is behind you "".
3 - When they take decisions about the picks and they take it very lightly on the last game, it is always better to reinforce your moral with a comfort pick than making the perfect plan which involve you're gonna play a game with a non stop thaught coming to your mind every second of it ( "" I don't like this, I don't like this, I'm too bad with this pick "" ).

I don't know if they are totally aware of what they did or if it was just a "" don't give a fuck "" induced behavior, but they fucking nailed it and what they did is pbbly the most beautiful human thing I saw for a long time !",@Clickmoi,UCn4aZHjmtvJ_yY7Q7e6P7pQ,2019-04-25T00:25:50Z,2019-04-25T00:28:46Z,35,1

UgzAFwYR449Yvra9U3t4AaABAg,"Other MOBAs have ranked roles free, why make this function paid? in what logic one should pay for this feature if instead, they could've made tutorial better with pro guides by hiring professional coaches or making videos by segregating them by naming each and every guide made by a different coach having their own guide in 

their style or by their perspective so what will happen is if containing a bundle of these video guides/tutorials or whatever you'd like to name/call it in the plus so new players could've gotten introduced to DotA even more and didn't quit it by experiencing terrible community who 

knows about the game and expects others to have that knowledge as well, these kinda things leads newbies to quit DotA instantly and play other game instead, obviously they're missing the depth of the game here or immersive knowledge or fresh experience offered by Valve's weekly or daily patches which keeps game more interesting and more challenging for any mind. Dota is sick by no means.  

Instead of trying something new they just updated the UI and added new sets, pretty ignorant plus is trash instead bring back seasonal battle passes some people are ready to pay more if it 

comes to that but this shit nope plus is trash, with the battle pass and new skins they could've gotten more player base since players love getting new skins even fortnut is doing same stunts bps. either Add this videos or some new function, I mean you don't have to make coaching guides free either, make them paid some players are even willing to pay even more 

and plus since coaching shouldn't be free in the first place, players will like for an example 'X' coaches video more than 'A' coaches videos so they'll pay more for that service or like any other cosmetic in game X coaches guide will more likely is labelled with a greater price. And why one should use something Game Leap or any other third party sites for this obvious I don't know a trick? perhaps you should call it or this coaching stuff just add it in DotA plus, ad it may affect player base in a positive way.",@godsoffice5714,UCtqWFSDzgjKgXyAnscTUTDw,2019-02-07T13:20:18Z,2019-02-07T13:20:18Z,0,0

UgzJWbfrvzgKZbu18zd4AaABAg,"Flux is a global decentralized gaming ecosystem based on blockchain technology. This is the first solution on the market of e-sports entertainment, which provides decentralized interaction between gamers, spectators and the platform itself. Flux is an ecosystem that provides multi-level gameplay interactivity, as well as giving players numerous new channels to monetize cybersport achievements that are not available on existing platforms. FLUX is also a platform for competitive games and tournaments, a marketplace for gaming products, a platform for online broadcasting of games and funding for game projects.

The FLUX team includes professionals with deep practical experience in eSports, gaming, digital television, media, blockchain technologies, as well as major Internet holdings, and has an excellent practical understanding of the market structure, consumer behavior, and conversion attraction models.

The economy of FLUX assumes absolute globality, lack of borders, and its own token (FLUX) will become the main payment instrument within the ecosystem. We are also pleased to note the readiness of the leading professionals in the blockchain and eSports industry to join the project partners. Coupled with the project team - this is really a reliable fusion of the best expertise in the industry. Our partners have already become:

¬∑ Infopulse

¬∑ Axon Partners

¬∑ Bionic University

¬∑ Ambisafe

¬∑ Provectus

FLUX is an ecosystem in which all participants, including spectators, become full members of the system. Participants can interact with each other on equal terms, as well as make money in each segment of the platform. This is an independent generator of game content and a potential partner for other cyber sports platforms. With its help, you can constantly integrate new products and attract as many partners as possible who will interact with the audience using the blockchain.

New level of interaction

We offer a system that will allow players to earn wins in competitive matches and tournaments, trade in game items, conduct game broadcasts, or raise funds to develop their own games within the platform. Investors (invested in internal games) and developers will receive a certain commission for each game transaction.

The FLUX ecosystem is built around gameplay. While the players compete with each other and generate the prize money in the game using matchmaking platforms, they also buy / sell each other game related items using the FLUX marketplace, or buy goods in the FLUX store, the developer (Game Creator), which downloaded and verified the game in the FLUX Developer Market, receives a portion of the commission taken by the platform from transactions and rates.

In case Game Creator raised funds to create this game using the FLUX crowdfunding platform, a part of its income is also distributed among investors.

In addition, the gameplay can be broadcast using the FLUX Streaming platform and integration with Twitch, so the platform receives a new audience, and the streamer automatically receives a reward.

The whole ecosystem is built using a system of multiple smart contracts, so all the described actions are processed automatically.

Using blockchain technology and smart contracts, the whole process becomes as transparent and automated as possible, which makes the platform a strong extension of the existing industry and makes it possible to use cryptocurrency in real business.",@–†—É—Å–ª–∞–Ω–°–∞–º–µ–¥–æ–≤-—Ö3–∑,UCR6la-cgim-F5kibKisuMfg,2019-01-23T13:08:27Z,2019-01-23T13:08:27Z,0,0

The only thing i am sad about is that the community is not growing, its not that we lose lots of players, its that we are all old now and we play less and less. We are all mostly veterans now. You hardly find new players playing dota 2. And i blame valve on this one. All these years and i have never seen an advertisment to play dota 2. You can browse anywhere in the internet and find LOL adds, or adds for other games. Why doesnt valve focus on advertising the game ? It will be just a fraction of their millions they made out of dota 2 which will pay back from skins purchases from new players.

see you guys in Sing's Twitch maybe

P.S. don't fight over who the MVP was, it's definitely Ceb's paper. See how LGD's players make so much fuss about it with their eyes trembling. LOL

Jokes aside, damn OG deserves to win. All Notail talk about Dota being a mental game; to have the mentality keep playing to win even when they are losing, both when taking game 4 and 5, is above average human. One shred of ""We lost this"" thought would have lost them everything. Many would crumble and break down in that situation and I won't blame them for it, yet OG prevailed and won.

And there are many splendid, game changing group fights that should be highlighted in this video, which were not included out of no reason. In fact, in Game 5, it is totally a winning game for LGD if they been less cocky, instead of BKB, Kunka purchased the pricy Tarrasque which make him vulnerable and useless in the group fights, and the key Roshan fight after a battle win, Chalice TP to the down lane, trying to slay prophet on himself  instead of slaying Roshan together, made it lack of damage to slay the Roshan in time, gave OG the opportunity to win the fight and Aegis, which become a game changer afterwards. So, this video should be called ""A Glimpse (of TI8 Final) "" instead of ""True Sight"", because it is biased and poorly scripted. Finally, we both agree this is the most splendid TI final of all time, two TI deserving team brought us a feast of eyes. PS.

Ugw6UWr6JS-BDU2s9oN4AaABAg,"Just for starters here is some info about what they're talking about (the positions):
*this is just for beginners, those who really have no idea. don't hate me for the comment

Position 1: is the hardest carry, the priority position. one who gets most of the farm and avoids early to mid-game teamfights unless completely necessary and does not hurt farm time.
(heroes: anti-mage, TB, Void)

Postion 2: typically the midlaner. the role of this position is to destroy the enemy position 2, while also being able to roam and help get kills for the carry. all the while avoids getting killed by 3 or 2 man-ganks at mid (heroes: Shadow Fiend, QoP, Storm)

Position 3: the suicide/sacrificial lane, usually solos the lane against the enemy safelane (tho suicide lanes now are also played dually). main job is just to not get killed and holding his tier 1 tower for as long as possible. most of the time gets no farm at all too due to pulling and lane management of enemy safelane. heroes in this lane are those with hard sustain and escapes
(heroes: Treant, Axe, Necrophos, Mirana)

Position 4: the roaming support/jungler. it is usually the player with the best macro skill and mindset in the game. *most teams have their captains as position 4. primary role is to help set up kills by roaming, smoke ganking and causing destruction on other lanes while also successfully warding/dewarding key areas
(heroes: Enigma, Earthshaker, Tusk)

Position 5: the babysitter support. the one whose just only job is to always help the carry when being hunted or ganked. main job is to not let the hard carry die.
(heroes: crystal maiden, wisp, shadow shaman)",@hardstuckboom3r504,UCS17o56iQrPs_g5lZpyA8lA,2019-01-18T10:18:53Z,2019-01-18T10:18:53Z,8,2

They forced meta into rosh pit and didn't get the rosh in game 5, it all went bad from 1 fight... If there was a captain to call of smokes and shots, it would have been different, they need someone like ceb in the team... Ember zeus is shit, literally shit hero in that patch, they got raped early and managed to equalize and win when lgd basically forced a failed rosh attempt... Unnecessary risk... And game 4 was lost, because of broken PL lvl 25, they didnt realize how OP PL lvl 25 was and needed to force something before PL lvl 25... It's like mega creeps, you can't let that happen or else 70-80% you just lost the game...

I can't help but feel this echos the differences between the east and the west when looking  at approaches to problem solving, eSports and life in general.

The Chinese had a team of mechanically gifted players who had a great understanding of the patch at the time and had momentum coming into TI8. They relied heavily on a structured play style and applied conventional thinking/understanding to the game.

LGD were outperforming every team until  they met a team who were equally gifted in mechanics, but came into the finals utilising analytics  (LGD were concerned with Cebs stack of papers) and statistics and thought outside the circle. They played and picked heroes that are deemed unconventional in the patch, completely throwing LGD off (ember, Zeus picks).  

OG even with everything on the line stressed having fun, doing different things and putting the team first as their priority and they shined when under pressure. 

Despite being an EG fan and all the drama that lead up to the tournament I can't help but be happy for this team.

UgyfeIzfFuQBguVQ1Zt4AaABAg,"i think its all comes down to game 4 and 5. i can clearly see the mentality. 
i mean... OG. as a team when shits just happened, sure they mourned a little, then i goes back into fun talk. the mentality getting back up. notice that they lost horribly during the laning phase. what did they do? they dont blame anyone, they encourage each other.
i mean.. Ceb was such a good guy. topson having a hard time during early game 4. ""its ok its ok. im gonna fuck them"" such confident in his axe. and it wasnt just a talk, call into sunstrike combo, getting topson back in the map.
such focus from ana.. i mean he cant even notice jerax talking to him, for me personally, if i was too focused on something, suddenly everything went mute. i guess thats what it is.
during game 5. the same thing happened. ""hey we got topson's zeus, ana's ember."" its ok we got late game"".
and i think.. the turning point was after the rosh fight. what happened here? prophet baiting them, lgd, thinking they had the opening, used everything they got on him. then come the 2nd fight. jerax, being a great ES player himself know exactly whats gonna happen, he told them to man up, ""no echo he got nothing!"" and i can see pretty well the rubick always man marking the ES, look at the amount of that stolen fissure.
im not trying to say anything but, its obvious in term of mentality, when shit happens, LGD start blaming each other. only when the captain FY tell them its fine, then they shut the fuck up, even then, they know it wasnt ok, they just cant say it out loud.
i mean im an asian myself, i found that.. was always a thing here. wtf is wrong with us guys.",@Ressel_,UCLYHNWuQXl2IUNBh-ZpOYig,2019-01-16T10:16:19Z,2019-01-16T10:16:19Z,0,0

All I knew this whole time  is that I wanted to play Dota and nothing else. But as time went on I just lost all focus, even dropping the game since 2014. Now 5 years later OG have made me recover the fuel I once had. I used to play on 4.5k bracket eventually reaching 5k but no more than that. I was so frustated with myself that I ended up dropping everything,from dota, from studies, even dropping the selfsteem I had and it's been like that for the past 5 years. Last year however after watching the same guy that motivated me to play meepo and micro intensive heroes win TI after all these years it felt like a call from destiny a call to try my best again. I might not be on my best form yet,as I got calibrated into archon IV a far cry from what it used to be. But be sure to pin this one valve, I'm coming,I can feel the fuel I once had inside me doesn't matter how, it doens't matter if I have to sleep 4 hours a day between work and play I'll be there in Shangai this year and even if I don't I can sure as hell be confident enough to say that I tried my  best.",@Ziule192,UCV4YORrHmCVlgv5c9IfMTKA,2019-01-16T03:13:29Z,2019-01-16T03:13:29Z,69,21
