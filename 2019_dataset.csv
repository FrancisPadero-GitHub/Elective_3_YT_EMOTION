UgyZP-TdJZtuqydoxnJ4AaABAg,"after multiple times watching this. this is what i can conclude;

the clash of champions on the grandest stage of dota, the international. where better to go head on. the first team to 3-0 a grand final (liquid) vs the greatest cinderella story in the history of esports (og). both going only dropping one game throughout the entire bracket (they won 2-1 to THE PSG.LGD). both are undeniably great champions on their own. prodigy vs prodigy (ana & miracle), top pos 4 of that time (gh & jerax), generals of the game (ceb & mc),  creative and mechanically gifted midlaners (topson & w33ha) and seasoned captains (kuro & notail). fun fact, kuro has played every hero in dota at professional level at that time.

for those who are critical of kuro, bear in mind that the guy is a champion. his team follows his call. being in the grand final is a feat in itself. guy's a hell of a leader. he knows how to boost the morale of his team and how to make them fight for him. but that is the brutal reality of being a leader. all the blame will go to u first. nonetheless, i respect him for standing firm on his decision and his team for believing and following in every calls he shot. it may not have been the best decision and calls, but he did what he does best: leading. my key takeaway from him is how optimistic and emphatic he is. he believes strongly in every decision he makes even on the verge of defeat. and how he comforts w33ha after his 2nd loss at a ti grand final. shoutout to w33ha too for being such a resilient and outspoken soul.

notail and his sunflowers. such insane team bond and chemistry. u cant teach that. pair his perseverance and resilience with a wise man like ceb, all is well in the team. liquid with their laser focus and dead set on winning the first game while the boys are busy with their chat wheels. they were in the zone the moment they stepped in the stadium. they know they will win it, thus the laid back atmosphere. compared to liquid's draft phase, they were all pouring in information without discrimination. they were open to every possibility. the security in knowing that everyone in the team believes in each other further strengthens them.

the key difference in this series is who is more willing to adapt and change. kuro was stubborn with his combo (tide & ta) while og as a whole was being like water, bending and curving to every picks and bans of liquid while maintaining their personal qualities. mc being confident in his tidehunter was good, but he did not respect og as a team. his confidence and hardheadedness in picking tidehunter is understandable, considering they went to the finals after fighting everyone. but his opponent is not like any other team. in the first game, they almost lost. this may have triggered the ego in mc to prove to everybody including his team that his tide is the shit. hence, the constant picking of tide 3 in a row. the almost lost first game shook his confidence, the 2nd game just completely dismantled it. this led to him not thinking rationally and costing them the game. the same also applies to w33ha. this shows the double edged sword of false confidence.

for those who wants to know the logic behind topson's diffusal gyro, it was to counter miracle's bb. bb burns his mana very fast due to the low cds of his spells. add diffusal to that and u have a bb that cant proc his ult. the og in this ti was their peak. the culmination of every step taken by them. all led to this moment. no other team came close to them. each player possessed distinct qualities that were one of one, incomparable and unique to each and every one of them. they were years ahead of every team and the meta.

tl;dr -  og was just too good. they played comfortably without getting their psyche and concentration rattled. they navigated through every situation of the game with insane amount of tranquility and knowledge. imo they gave liquid the gentleman's sweep over the respect of them being the champions of dota too.",@muhdazizan2158,UCcMNbtzv2gc_3bZxaot6mGQ,2025-07-16T16:53:55Z,2025-07-16T16:53:55Z,1,2

Ugxi4JcbDrO6azrlMWd4AaABAg,"In the first game, Team Liquid players were in sync — they were feeling each other, calling plays together, and working as one unit. But before the second game, the coach said, “Listen to Kuro, don’t make calls, just focus on the game.” After that, they lost.

In OG, every player makes plays, feels the game, and supports each other. There’s no single leader or captain — everyone leads. But in Liquid, only KuroKy makes the calls, and the rest of the team just follows orders.

After a tough loss, that foolish captain KuroKy told MC, “Play like Ceb.” What a disrespectful thing to say. And then they lost again.

I think KuroKy kills his teammates’ creativity and playstyles. Before True Sight 9, I respected him. But after I saw that “be like Ceb” moment, I lost all respect for him — both as a professional player and as a person.",@Etsa17,UCdt9XlfuySH3ihOMyNMRtZg,2025-05-23T15:55:00Z,2025-05-23T15:55:00Z,2,0

w33: Ohh shit! Fck Meepo, man. I want TA, look at *""THEIR""* heroes....

Miracle-: (interrupting w33) But Meepo too. Look at the heroes, *""WE""* have Tide Chen

What we learn from this is that we shouldn't look what others have but we should consider what's ours (and vice versa) and draw/plan the best strategy to achieve optimum result; also, there are things in life that we thought it's already the best but there is something even better than that.. Letting w33 play TA in game1 might be effective but the Meepo was efficient. Good thing Miracle- insisted it. Though w33 was hesitant at first but considering that Miracle- was also S-class in playing TA probably the reason that w33 accepted to play Meepo. As a result, they won the game1 and Meepo was banned the next entire games. Mad respect to w33's Meepo.

I have been watching this to get inspired, to lift my spirits up after being knocked down, betrayed so many times in life. The most pure team of trust and friendship, 2 ti's back to back with the same roster. I remember it clear as day when everyone said OG will fail and they didnt crash. They lift each other up, have fun and dont focus on winning. I guess I pretty much learn so much from watching their stories.

This has been a tradition since TI8 and will keep coming back everytime I got demotivated.

great player great legacy but literally not charismatic at ALL and you sense the tension within that booth vs Ceb who literally says the same shit he says, but in a way that brings the teams mood up. 
Kuro really needs to work on his leadership abilities and social awareness OR focus on being a good player and give someone else the job of shot-calling, being the leader. W33 is also the most egotistical player, saying this that silence the room, giving kuro great opportunities to both keep them in line whilst staying confident. saying ""stay confident boys, just dont do what you did"" doesnt make ur team confident. Saying ""shit happens guys, doesnt matter"", whilst clearly acknowledging the mistake when making draft or in game choices.  ""the game is over when we get BKB"" and ignoring w33, fucking toxic leader that cant let go of their ego. its so fucking cringe and sad to see other great players get dragged down to the same level and toxic mid playerss and a leader that cant communicate. wouldnt be surprised if kuro is on the spectrum

UgyQoqmcfQPG5d9y9wR4AaABAg,"Love re watching this except the two major cringe moments. First Ceb and Notail  telling Ana to wait to buyback game 1 but then he does and they lose and everyone is like it's okay Ana no big deal like it was his fault but if they had let him BB when he first asked they'd have been fine lol and then the obvious one which is Kuroky telling MC to play more like Ceb. What really got me about it was Kuroky isn't a good captain. Tells him team not to talk, while OG says to focus but to have open commutation even in new OG that's what they teach them. But he also messed up his teams morale those ways. And during drafts he always makes massive mistakes, saying ""F#*$ the Ember"" but Miracle a way better player is saying let's take it, and of course OG take it and own the game. He also copied Notail and Ceb's speech from TI8 true sight and said we play on our terms and we play our comfort heroes. But when MC who top 10 offlaner both in pubs and pro scene especially back then, say's he thinks NP will work best this game. He's instantly told no and to play omni. Then they guess IO is going to be support even after watching Ana play it as carry several games in TI9 and win all of them. If he played NP they might have stood a smaller chance. Having a offlane like Omni and a mid lane like WR doesn't give you much team fight damage. NP with carry items could have picked off Ana at start of fights using bloodthorn etc. He could pushed harder and actually got that tier 1 they needed early and he could have teleported and ganked Ana early several times slowing down the agh's timing. Omni was a horrible pick. And I'm 5k MMR and I can figure that out.",@chrisdann7017,UCoWGcoua4zK5_FNgy2HGpmw,2023-04-24T21:01:08Z,2023-04-25T00:52:26Z,1,0

Since 2017-2018 I've stopped playing DotA and come back to it once in a half a year or so ... play for a week and that's about it, afterall I love this game like none other, but my friends stopped playing and going at it solo ain't just my thing, I like having a banter warfare with my friends whilst playing, listening to the same song via discord/spotify and just have a good vibe.
Well anyway, me not playing DotA that much nowdays only shows, how distanced I've got away from Pro scene ... most of the names are unknown to me, only EG looks almost the same line-up, the rest of the teams are just unknown for my stupid ass.
One or two names in a team I know, but the rest?
Which is not a bad thing, I'll get more surprise performances since I don't know what to expect from anyone, but it's kinda hard for me to pick a favorite xd
I always picked two teams which I cheered for, but this year I'll probably lean towards TSM ... I don't know why and what's making me choose them, but I feel like they'll do a phenomenal show!

Well anyway... whoever wins, I'm in such a big mood for some good DotA!

Ugwth3GNJVOsqAIR6k54AaABAg,"Kuro's leadership style is authoritative putting way too much pressure on him. It worked just well enough to get them to the finals, but no further.
Notice these subtle moments when Weehaa wants to say something but stops himself - it's not that he lacks self-confidence, it's that he is pressured by the leader to ""not talk"", ""just listen to Kuro"". Also, such a formula will lift off the responsibility from players, as each one of them will subconsciously think that it's the leader's fault if they lose.
Only use authoritative style as an instrument when discipline needs to be exercised, don't let it become your general tool.

I don't dislike Kuro, he's a legend, but we can derive some interesting leadership antipatterns from the missed clues that the team gave to him.

Look at how MindControl says ""I want Nature Prophet"", gets totally ignored, and goes along with Omni, but with zero enthusiasm.
How GH is pretty much begging Kuro to give him Tiny and Kuro gives that sideways glance displaying mistrust. Don't let your subordinates see you doubting them! Not in such a defining moment anyways.",@mykhailomiroshnikov,UC6tdkvZtj5CR4cF2YCHylAA,2022-02-21T19:14:27Z,2022-02-21T20:20:48Z,1,0

1. You don't throw questions back to your team. You're supposed to answer them with answers and not questions.
2. You don't tell your members to shut up and just listen. That makes him a boss. Nowhere near a leader.
3. You don't ask your members ""what do we do against them?"".
4. You need to live up to your words. Repeating back and forth on we skip Tide/TA but keep going back to it each time shows how little hero combinations/synergies he is aware of unlike Ceb/Notail.

L'esperienza diversificata e ricca ci dice che la convinzione di alcuni oppositori consente di valutare l'importanza delle condizioni finanziarie e amministrative esistenti. Solo gli azionisti delle societa piu grandi sono descritti nel modo piu dettagliato possibile.Nel loro tentativo di migliorare la qualita della vita, dimenticano che la struttura esistente dell'organizzazione fissa in modo inequivocabile la necessita di nuovi principi per la formazione della base materiale, tecnica e personale. Ma i rappresentanti delle moderne riserve sociali sono stati trasformati in uno zimbello, sebbene la loro stessa esistenza porti indubbi benefici alla societa.❤️
一方、最新の技術の導入は、新しい提案の関連性を保証します。現代の社会保護区の代表者だけが政治参加の方法に過ぎず、一連の独立した研究の対象となっています。組織の既存の構造では、スーパータスクのタイムリーな実装の分析が必要です。ちなみに、制度化の勝利の明確な兆候は、そのレベルに関係なく、完全に認識できなくなるまで、一意でないデータと混合する必要があります。これにより、それらの役に立たない状態が増加します。",@allisondiaz6688,UCicdTybt0udptMiHibjCHnw,2021-04-16T14:13:56Z,2021-04-16T14:13:56Z,11,0

- Before OG drafted Void (Game 3)
- The talk after game 2 (When he points out the weakness of the draft)

Kuro: That's what they do. They stress everyone out. But they can't stress us out man. You have the calmest motherfucker on the planet here.

Kuro proves it @ 21:20 Everyone screamed their lungs out on their win with Kuro just saying “Nice.”

*After getting run by OG multiple times in a row*

35:17 
Kuro, Liquid's captain, usually the one behind all, picks, bans, strats, and counters: What do we do against it?

Just shows that Kuro is starting to feel the pressure and is losing himself in the process. OG was unstoppable once they run at you and Kuro can't seem to think of something to counter it.

*Game 4, with OG leading the finals 2-1*

57:06
Kuro: Time to go like monkey mode, like they do it.

1:03:11 
Mind Control: By the way guys, don't pick your heroes right away. They don't... they don't pick their heroes right away we should do the same.

Kuro after that: Let's fucking go with... let's fucking go with our terms guys.

Again, Kuro, losing himself here. 

And with this...

1:09:39

Kuro shouting “Nice... NIIIIICE!” just shows how he completely lost his calmness trying to win the game for the team. He lost his true self by becoming someone else. He let his emotions get into his head and onto the game. They went to the finals for a reason, they're a strong team, but I think one factor that completely turned it around is that they lost themselves trying to play in their heads instead of focusing in the game itself.

UgxKtJrKcBhOQuva3VB4AaABAg,"The most common fish in the sea is likely a fish that you’ve never seen or maybe even heard of.

You may be scratching your head and wondering how that is possible but consider the scale of the ocean.  Approximately 70% of the earth’s surface is covered by ocean with an average depth of 2.3 miles.  For reference, that’s about the same distance as the average altitude for sky divers.  So, all that air between sky divers and the earth is the same as all that water between the ocean surface and ocean floor.  And, once beyond the continental shelf into the deeper depth zones, the habitat in the ocean is relatively homogeneous; many of the species that inhabit it are globally panmictic, meaning that the same species is found anywhere around the world.

All things considered,  it may not be so surprising that the most common fish in the sea lives in this uniform habitat, at 1000 feet or deeper, and can be found anywhere around the world.  What is this elusive, ubiquitous fish?  Bristlemouths.

UgwujdEeZZo22M_VtYh4AaABAg,Honestly OG is the better team and this video hard proves it. Liquid had a chance though to take the grand finals if Kuroky stopped commanding during picks and bans. He didn't listen to MC and Miracle who had the right mind for the picks and bans. Game 4 he talks about getting everyone on what they're comfortable on but turns around and tells MC he can't play the hero he is feeling in the moment. MC was taken out of this series not from OG but from the failure in proper leadership by Kuroky.,@lloydm95,UCaaqCTUlpqH2Qyo0pWrEJuA,2020-08-27T18:24:10Z,2020-08-27T18:24:10Z,277,33

So I was rooting for him, but I can't root against N0tail. I hope they play together once more before its all said and done. I believe W33 lost the games because he asked for picks that were horrible against OG playstyle. TA and WR need to have strong starts and they need to be ahead to be able to do anything, otherwise they are absolutely useless. Liquid should have picked more static control heroes that are better at taking ganks and prolong team fights, such as Invoker, Necro, Ember etc. I hope they will do better this year.

UgzSqeiQN3mXs0tcXyF4AaABAg,"Let's give credit to Miracle in this series. He deserves a team like OG who can play with his flexibility. Their loss here is the fault of W33 and Kuro. 

W33's best hero is TA? even in pub games you will learn that refraction procs pugna ward. You say he's nervous? See Ana got trashed but came back? See Topson play TI straight from pubs? See Ceb return to playing after being a coach? If he cannot handle the mainstage chills at his second finals then he should not have been there. 
Kuro wake up. Meta is always changing.
Can play Meepo with W33 to confuse OG? W33 says no. 
Can play BB with W33? W33's not comfortable with it. Proudly says 'I won my last BB game' indicating how he had not practiced with it much but still confident to play it.
Jugg as suggested by Kuro. Confidently accepts the role even when he did not realize that it was a 'good pick'.
I think Miracle has the talent to play like Topson and be 'unpredictable' but Liquid failed to utilize that talent.

Meanwhile liquid they can't even guess the players who'll play the hero and that's what's strong on og's draft it's flexible they pick tiny which can be played mid or 4. They confused their enemy's always. Also hate the fact that that kuro won't allow MC play what he wants MC in this series is really mentally done. Add salt to injury asking him to play the way the opponent team OFFLANE plays. He looked pale like blood is being drained from his body. Og playing for fun and Liquid playing to win.

Before the match starts, LGD decides to mute them, which is a good thing to start with every single game. If you're capable of being tilted, Mute everyone and enjoy playing.

UgyL-JES43bsFn77TQp4AaABAg,"It's so easy to see why OG won.
They won because they just vibe the right way! Yes, usually the skill and knowledge are the most important, but they aint shit without the good energy amongst teammates.
Just look at the Liquid: they are all just swearing and spitting on OG just like that, nothing but being rude (i dont give a shit for the reasons, it's just fucked up). While OG is just classy all the fucking way. You can see a lot of things when you focus on player's behavior and their responses in certain actions. Sure, KuroKy has played for a very long time, but you can feel his bad energy which is more like a boss energy rather than a leader one, which is a huge thing in my opinion. There is just no synergy and that shit gets you confused, which is proven here, while OG thrived because of an awesome, yet simple camaraderie. The ende!

If there is a team that deserved to beat OG in this final it was Liquid, but better luck next year. These games may have sucked for you but they got me playing Dota for the first time in 2019.

If you guys want to blame someone, blame this dude, he wants to have only KuroKy speak? Like? What? In a team fight? Only one to order? How? It's a team fight for a reason, because everyone is participating.

This dude, seriously, just because he wants KuroKy to represent the whole team? Lmao, what's the use of professional players if they can't demonstrate their own gameplay, blame this bossy person, but still, because of this dude, I won more than $5,000 worth of items! So, yeah, although you made Team Liquid lose, you made me win so much, thanks!

OG FTW!

But seriously, if you want a team to be played by a single player, go for RTS instead, each pro has their own plays, that's why they are pro, if this useless dude that has no talent for playing didn't say shiits like let Kuro order you around, they could've had at least 30% more chance of winning. I mean, really, which pro does want to get ordered? Just check all of their faces, especially when they wanted to say something.

Ugx25MYjCm8LAj8fIU14AaABAg,"It's insane how untouchable OG were in this time frame. This entire season they had already won the mental game. Having fun with every game they played, inside of every opponent's heads. Even in this documentary, Liquid win the first game and the difference in their demeanor after the match is so drastic. They just won Game 1 and Liquid is already in the back telling each other not to let OG in their heads, not to get stressed out, meanwhile OG lost and they're just joking around with each other, loose and completely at ease. I believe OG won this TI the moment they stepped into the arena, because mentally they were just completely untouchable. Sure, it was also a good meta for their team, but it didn't shift into a meta that was already good for them -- they shifted into what the meta is. That's one of the things they do best, and it's the reason they won two TIs back to back. From the moment they start playing they are completely in control mentally. It took almost no time after Liquid won game 1 for them to get tilted in game 2. They didn't build up any kind of momentum or steam because OG was already in their heads.",@tempestSH,UCslTWIrO7cwHVsjahQV3rvQ,2020-02-16T09:17:17Z,2020-02-16T09:17:17Z,2,0

""w33 acted like an asshole and said shit about OG."" Stuff like that. I don't think anything w33 did or said was that bad at all, and they don't deserve it. 

They've had a rough beginning of the year so far, not doing very well, but they are still TI champs, and are  better players than any of the retards in Twitch chat. I mean, come on GH is a god, and like the nicest guy on Earth. How could you hate on him?  It's hilarious to me that people have to try and drag others down, to make themselves feel better.

They always find and have a way to squeeze themself out in the hardest situation and made a comeback.

My fully respect to Kuro, eventhough they lose at TI9 but he still be Thankful for What they have achieve and given by HIM. Kuro also praised OG really well, it is not an easy thing to do after you just lose your TI Grand Final.

It just isnt the same game. Its not fun when you see

even if alchemist gets killed 10 times in first 10 minutes, by 15 he will
have radiance. And you just see how its bad when patches get followed up
by other 10 patches to fix the original one, patches so severe they throw the game
around like raggdoll. Pro scene is aklso different, players get swapped like used socks,
how can you cheer for a team if by the end of the month they egt swapped 100% by
new -players. Old teams before were way more stable. Like, who is in EG today thats an EG player?

I was at Ti8 and Ti9 cheering for LGD both times, and watching this is like a stab to my heart. But, at the end of the day, no matter which team I like, I love beautiful dota. And OG brought the most beautiful dota. Just looking at Ceb and Notail communicating, encouraging, vibing up all their teammates is something we don't see much in the Chinese Dota scene. The only coach that has that effect in the China region is probably just rOtk. On another note, I blame myself a little bit for the Chinese teams not enjoying Dota as much as the western teams. The Chinese players always have too much expectations on them and it's always win or bust for them. In the end, I'm sad that Jerax retired and Ceb decided to go back to coaching, and I wish them the best.

The fact that Liquid could not avoid the unstoppable force that was Jerax 4 tiny is the real edge here.
I feel like this happens a lot with TI winning teams, EGM was  actualy GM at 4 when Alliance won. GH was undeniably the best 4 in the world when Liquid won.

That is pretty fucked up telling a TI winner who was also the MVP of that TI to play like an another TI winner. You could absolutely tell MC was tilting playing 3 Tide games in a row. Also Topson's item builds were on point in all his games. Diffusal Gyro to burn all of BB's manas. Their timing was so good with IO hitting level 15 with Aghs. OG was definitely the better team.

obviously OG got their numbers sure as shooting. they  predicted everything in liquid's head. at the last game. liquid was in the lead. but OG knew, its because liquid was always comes at them, and they had no answer to it. at least not yet. then comes gyro diffusal. and IO lvl 15. i mean.. talk about unexpected, the game changing item was. a fucking tome. if he didnt grab that tome right there, they would lose that teamfight for damn sure. talking about crucial timing there.


btw omar. im pretty sure you somehow watch this truesight, hell every dota players mustve watch it.
it must be excruciating. reaching TI grandfinal twice, and the same thing happen again. i had my fair share of failure as well, its feels like the universe doesnt want you to win TI ever right? but thats not true, all we gotta do is try harder. that last game wasnt your fault man.
it might be true you could have done more, but from what i see.. BB was completely shut down by the diffusal, and you are the only damage dealer the team has. it was a pretty great job. anyone else couldnt have done any better than that. im pretty sure, it was a pretty hard game.

Ugw0EqsMdQgdmgEdwo94AaABAg,"From the very begining of this truesight, i've already know that Liquid going to lose this one. Their mood and communication at the chamber (or whatever its name) is very bad. First I thought that maybe Liquid is already exhausted from whole lower bracket series. Then in the break after game 1, when Kuro said ""just let me do the talk"" (or whatever he said) I already feel he put huge pressure on his self. I feel Kuro is badly want to win this one, so bad that he broke him self. And game after game it's look more clear and clear that he is already broke since the begining. I keep watch this entire video. And then 1:20:24 appeared. I realized it, the reason why Kuro put so much pressure on him self. He just want to retired. He is already play Dota since TI 1 and even before. Everyone would be exhausted, tired, and bored by experiencing it. So he want to close his career with a history. Huge history. A story for whole Dota 2 players. An example for anyone who want to play Dota. A legacy for everyone. He want to end his career by being the first ever Dota 2 team and captain to win 2 TIs, no one that ever achieved ever. Time goes on. I still see the same problem from Liquid's final performance in Team Nigma now. Personally, I think Nigma would be recreat the team and Kuro would retired after 2-3 more Major.

I never seen a captain make his teammates so comfortable like Ceb. Think about it, the other 4 are kinda low energy, low output in speaking, and he had to make up for it , in morale boosting and speaking. And probably Jerax too, in my book he was the best dota player, his plays are unnoticed but he is insanely godlike. Gh only plays 3 heroes good, io, es, and kotl, that's what won them ti8. Now compare to Jerax's hero pool and how you draft against that? Kuro recognised Jerax is the MVP early on. I'm just sorry Ceb didn't win TI earlier, because he had idiot's like Synderen with their stupid bad ideas blocking him from captaining.

OG were always one step ahead in drafts, always. Even the first game - they should have won that as well, Meepo VS ET is kinda stupid.
MC was done mentally, Miracle never got like a true performance hero, even Jugger didnt do much. GH seems to be quit and w33 seemed like a teenager amateur, like ""give me that, i`m gonna smash them"" etc.. Seemed like Kuro didnt even believe in their picks and plans - you can see that by them trying to convince that what they were doing was right, but pretty much after every big fight they were crumbled. Honestly i don't think they'll ever get a good place at TI ever with that w33's mindset and these kind of picks. And the coach - from the movie it didn't seem that they were listening to rmn at all - he seemed super stressed out and out of place. Nothing worked for them sadly.

UgyzpKVYPjOutoCuALV4AaABAg,"The reasons why I love and respect OG.

1) Topson had 100% Win rate on TI's. He doesnt lose any he played. He was taken to the team 2 months before TI, as you know the time to play and prepare was not enough, and before that he had never participated in such large tournaments in scale. He has a lot of beautiful highlights, such as on Arc Varden on Ti8 where he defended the base in solo, he constantly experiments and finds new ways to play DotA, which other players do not do to the extent that he does. I never understood why people for 2 years do not perceive him as one of the best midlaners. 

2) JerAx probably the most stable pos4. I marked his game back in 2015, and since then I do not remember once that he played without impact. I learned from him a good team game and raised 5500 mmr and the rule of any good 4 is to be in the right place at the right time and give the right skills at the moment. I'm sorry that he leaves the active roster. 

3) The things why we love N0tail. Well, rather, for the same reason as Topson, that he found a way to comeback on the pro scene and get out of the outsiders, in the dominant favorite, he played for 1 pos for 2-3 years (I don’t remember exactly), and then changed the role to the opposite 5. He was able to make the right decision in time when the rest of the players remain in their role after a series of setbacks. Well, he’s also NaruTail, because their team just threw a SasuFly 2 months before the int, his close friend with whom they had a dream together to win TI. And now for 2 years in a row he has been winning the Fly team (EG).

4) Ana. Ana has a really unbeliavable understanding and execution, he is the king of the late game and knows how to make the right decisions in different situations, for example, when he sold a talisman of evasion and ring of aquilla on ti8 so that he had enough to buyback, or when he fought 1x5 on the PL and confused LGD with illusions, and when he ran out of hp and mana, he baited LGD to the illusion, and he went to the shrine, and killed everyone. Or a satanic on a slark, he managed to turn his counters into virtues and vitality, 3 ways to survive the enemy’s focus are brilliant. 

5) Ceb. CEEEEEEEEEEEEEB. He gets the call of his lifetime. The decisive game OG vs LGD, usually OG play on Ana or from the space of Topson, but then he chopped everyone up and created space on hardlane Axe, it was so beautiful and emotional, he left his free line with a blink and began to kill everyone in a row. What won the game that they could easily lose due to the difference in pace between the teams. And I also admire his way of influencing team morale, he always encourages everyone and has his workpieces at the peak.

6) I also really love their approach to tournaments, they play not to win, but to have fun, I really loved their atmosphere in the team, their positive attitude, their calm faces and would like to see another tournament with the same roster, but unfortunately Jerax wants to leave, Ceb wants to become their coach as before, Ana left. I am grateful with all my heart to this team for the experienced emotions and a pleasant time.",@mireska6016,UCoKyjDyUFEMcdFCtEq8hzVg,2020-01-29T10:44:37Z,2020-01-29T11:45:11Z,112,12

UgzoEMtJKqkdyltc1Ad4AaABAg,"Few things...

It's crazy to see how old-Liquid, a TI winning roster that made it to a second TI final,  was so out of their depth vs OG. OG made them look like it was their first big tournament. The TI8-TI9 OG roster was easily the best Dota 2 team of all time and I think it will stay that way to a long time to come.

Second, I think old-Liquid really needed someone like Matu that can keep their energy up and positive. Their energy was down and negative even after the first game. It was like they were mentally defeated from the get-go, even after they won game 1. Contrast that with how Ceb can bring up a whole team's energy. I really think that played a big part in old-Liquid's performance.


And third, Kuro should really listen to his teammates and coach more. There were a handful of times where rmN, GH, MC and Miracle had suggestions that in hindsight proved to be absolutely right but Kuro didn't give them much attention.

Anyway, thanks again Valve. True Sight is truly a highlight of the year. I look forward to seeing what the new OG roster can accomplish and wish Nigma the best in 2020.

Liquid(Nigma) no se da cuenta de lo tenso y estresado que se siente Mind_Control, no lo apoyan. Kuroky se siente demasiado presionado, compara a MC con Ceb y le dice que le gusta el juego de Ceb y que lo imite. 


El punto débil fue Kuroky, por tener pocas opciones en el draft, pensar constantemente en la presión de OG, no pensar en como se siente MC, no escuchar a su ayudante que debía banear tiny.

Remember last true sight Notail said there are minds that are hard to break and yet they overcome Liquid. We may never see another beautiful Dota from this team (OG TI8-TI9 roster) again and also props to Liquid, but damn OG is really way ahead of time that is why they are 2 time TI champs also back to back champions.

They won me by their sportmanship and resilience. Not the best but the most inspiring. Especially, Kuro's leadership as he kept his faith to God and to his team mates. 

As for OG, they played so well. They knew how to counter their opponents and literally broke their confidence and minds. Ceb handled the confidence of Ana as they losed the first game and he was able to boost it up as game progressed. This is how the OG won back-to-back TI. Having Ceb as the backbone that holds and keeps the moral of the team, n0tail the heart that serves as the foundation of the team, Jerax the limbs that connects the plays so well, Ana the hands that executes the opponent merciless, and Topson oh my.
